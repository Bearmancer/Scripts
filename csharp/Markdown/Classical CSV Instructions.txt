When converting data into a CSV table for classical music, remember these columns [even if it's a box for an instrumentalist]:

Remember to always use "" for each field to prevent a single field accidentally splitting across multiple. Always output as plain text CSV and not markdown with formatting.

1. Composer name (format: last name, first name (middle name if exist -- do not retain superfluous numbering like '[17]'))
2. Work name (only works should be part of the CSV. Do not add an entry for each)
3. Soloist (specify instrument if multiple soloists exist)
4. Orchestra
5. Conductor
6. Year of recording (not to be confused with the year in which it was first released. If it spans multiple years then use format of YYYY-YY (i.e. 1939-41))
7. Duration (remember to add timings of individual movements to come at work duration)
8. [Optional] Recording venue (make this column only if data exists in the text supplied)
9. Miscellaneous (to make unusual remarks like the arranger of a piece or if a conductor other than the main one is leading an orchestra - in a conductor box )

____

Do not retain info of disc numbering or disc naming. Irrelevant. 
____

When parsing recording dates, you should match the work by its track numbers with the recording years given at the end to know when a specific piece is recording if an entire disc spans several years.
