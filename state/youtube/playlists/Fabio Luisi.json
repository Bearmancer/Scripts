    "Description": "A solemn mass with a symbolic character: The Frauenkirche in Dresden hosted its first public concert to mark its reopening on November 4, 2005. The program included Beethoven\u2019s Missa solemnis, performed by the Staatskapelle Dresden and the Chorus of the S\u00E4chsische Staatsoper Dresden, conducted by Fabio Luisi. The soloists were Camilla Nylund, Birgit Remmert, Christian Elsner and Ren\u00E9 Pape.\n\n(00:00) Intro\n(01:12) Kyrie\n(11:04) Gloria\n(29:00) Credo\n(49:10) Sanctus\n(1:05:34) Agnus Dei\n\nParticipants:\nCamilla Nylund | SOPRANO\nBirgit Remmert | ALTO\nChristian Elsner |TENOR\nRen\u00E9 Pape | BASS\nChorus of the Saxon State Opera Dresden\nMatthias Brauer | CHORUS MASTER\nDresden State Orchestra\nFabio Luisi | CONDUCTOR\n\nThe Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) with its high dome visible from afar is considered the landmark of the city of Dresden in Saxony. In the Second World War, this striking church was destroyed by bombs in February 1945 and existed for decades only as a ruin. From 1993 to 2005 it was rebuilt using the remaining rubble. Its reconstruction is a symbol of hope and reconciliation \u2013 and the magnificent church building with its unique blend of old and new bricks is intended to keep the memory of history alive.\n\nA work as festive as it is grand was chosen for the reopening concert. The Missa solemnis by Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 - 1827). The \u2018Solemn Mass\u2019 is considered one of the composer\u2019s most important works, and Beethoven himself even called it his greatest work on several occasions. The Mass for four soloists, choir, orchestra and orgue in D major, Op. 123 was composed between 1819 and 1823, after Beethoven had already studied in detail the Latin text of the Mass and its various settings by other composers. The Missa solemnis reflects Beethoven\u2019s struggle with religion and has a clearly confessional character. The individual parts of the mass are divided into five major compositional sections, giving the \u2018Great Mass\u2019 an almost symphonic aspect. This famous piece of church music demands a great deal from the vocal soloists, the choir and the large orchestra.\n\nBeethoven\u2019s Missa solemnis at the official reopening concert of Dresden\u2019s Frauenkirche in 2005: Experience a moving concert at a location with an eventful history.\n\nA Production of ZDF\nIn Cooperation with EuroArts Music International \u0026 ARTE\n\u00A9 2005 EuroArts\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlistlist=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#LudwigvanBeethoven #MissaSolemnis #churchmusic",

    "Title": "Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 1 | Margarita H\u00F6henrieder, Staatskapelle Dresden \u0026 Fabio Luisi",
    "Description": "Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major by Ludwig van Beethoven is Beethoven for piano virtuosos. Margarita H\u00F6henrieder shines on the piano, accompanied by the S\u00E4chsische Staatskapelle Dresden conducted by Fabio Luisi. The concert took place in 2008 at the Philharmonie im Gasteig Munich.\n\n(00:00) I. Allegro con brio\n(18:39) II Largo\n(29:50) III Rondo: Allegro scherzando\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770 - 1827) wrote seven piano concertos, five of which are numbered as opuses. The Piano Concerto in C major, Op. 15 is known as Piano Concerto No. 1, even though it was not the first concerto for piano that Beethoven wrote. First drafts for the Piano Concerto in C major date from 1793, a first complete transcription was available in late 1794 or early 1795, a new score existed before 1800 and finally the print appeared in 1801 after the solo part had been rewritten a second time. Beethoven probably performed an early version of the C major concerto himself in Vienna in 1795, where he is also thought to have performed a later version for the first time in 1800.\n\nBeethoven initially wrote his piano concertos primarily for himself. As a piano virtuoso, he wanted to show off his skills to an audience with the solo concertos; he was, after all, famous for his brilliant improvisations on the popular instrument.\n\nThere are similarities between the Piano Concerto in C major and Symphony No. 1, not only with respect to the period in which they were composed. In both works, the young Beethoven\u2019s knack of bringing forth the most diverse musical emotions from a simple thematic idea is already evident. And both works are characterized by a festive tone in which virtuosity is celebrated to the highest degree.\n\nMargarita H\u00F6henrieder discovered her love for the piano at an early age. She gave her first public performance at the age of seven in Munich\u2019s Herkulessaal. She studied with Anna Stadler and Ludwig Hoffmann in Munich, and later with renowned American pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher in Baltimore.\n\nIn 1981, she won First Prize at the prestigious Busoni Competition in Bolzano, joining the ranks of other notable Busoni laureates such as Martha Argerich and J\u00F6rg Demus. At the age of 28, she became Germany\u0027s youngest piano professor when she was appointed to the University of Music in W\u00FCrzburg. In 1991, she was appointed to the University of Music and Performing Arts in Munich.\n\nAs a soloist, Margarita H\u00F6henrieder has performed with many of the world\u2019s most celebrated conductors and orchestras, including Kirill Petrenko, Claudio Abbado, Lorin Maazel, James Levine, Ivor Bolton, Riccardo Chailly, and Fabio Luisi, as well as with major ensembles such as the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Munich Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.\n\n\u00A9 EuroArts Music International\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlistlist=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#LudwigvanBeethoven #PianoConcerto #MargaritaH\u00F6henrieder",

    "Title": "Mahler: Symphony No. 1 | Staatskapelle Dresden \u0026 Fabio Luisi 2008 (full symphony)",
    "Description": "In the footsteps of Gustav Mahler: Fabio Luisi conducts Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 1 in D major as if the composer himself were standing at the lectern. This performance by Staatskapelle Dresden took place in 2008 at the Philharmonie im Gasteig Munich.\n\n(00:00) I. Langsam. Schleppend. Im Anfang sehr gem\u00E4chlich (Slowly, dragging)\n(15:38) II. Kr\u00E4ftig bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell (Moving strongly, but not too quickly)\n(24:17) III. Feierlich und gemessen, ohne zu schleppen (Solemnly and measured, without dragging)\n(36:03) IV. St\u00FCrmisch bewegt (Stormily agitated \u2013 energetic)\n\nGustav Mahler (1860 - 1911) composed most of his first symphony between the end of 1887 and March 1888 and premiered it himself in 1889 \u2013 at that time as a \u201Csymphonic poem\u201D in five movements. The lack of success of the premiere resulted in years of struggle over how to present and program this weighty symphonic work. This process only came to an end in 1899 when the first symphony went to print. While working on it, Mahler had even at times assigned his orchestral symphony movement titles and the nickname \u2018Titan\u2019 (after the hero of Jean Paul\u2019s novel of the same name), which in the end he decided not to use.\n\nDespite its traditional four-movement structure, at times Mahler\u2019s First almost seems like a colorful, exuberant collage in which marches, fanfares, waltzes and folk songs abruptly alternate at times. As the main theme of the first movement, Mahler uses an instrumental version of the song \u2018Ging heut\u2019 morgen \u00FCber\u2019s Feld\u2019, which he had taken from his first song cycle \u2018Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen\u2019. This joyous walk is framed by onomatopoeic sounds from nature, where listeners have the impression they are hearing French horns and birdcalls. The \u2018musical wander\u2019 then builds up to a triumphant finale. In the second movement, a coarse, powerful L\u00E4ndler frames a sweetly wistful trio. This strident parody of folk music is reminiscent of an unbridled folk festival or busy fairground hustle and bustle. In contrast, the third movement begins as a funeral march, which turns out to be a minor-key version of the folk tune that became world-famous as the children\u2019s song \u2018Fr\u00E8re Jacques\u2019. The funeral march theme is contrasted with distorted insertions of pleasing themes. Again, a song from Mahler\u2019s first song cycle, this time \u2018Die zwei blauen Augen\u2019, provides the inspiration. In the fourth movement Mahler incorporates march music and other musical styles, and also revisits the theme of nature of the opening movement, although now it sounds more like a distant memory. The symphony culminates in a chorale that turns into a triumphant fanfare and concludes the thematic round. Mahler\u2019s Symphony No. 1 is a magnificent orchestral work, probably unsurpassed in its theatricality and irony, in which the tragic and the grotesque are never far apart.\n\n\u00A9 EuroArts Music International\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#GustavMahler #symphony #StaatskapelleDresden",
