The program included Beethoven’s Missa solemnis, performed by the Staatskapelle Dresden and the Chorus of the Sächsische Staatsoper Dresden, conducted by Fabio Luisi. The soloists were Camilla Nylund, Birgit Remmert, Christian Elsner and René Pape.\n\n(00:00) Intro\n(01:12) Kyrie\n(11:04) Gloria\n(29:00) Credo\n(49:10) Sanctus\n(1:05:34) Agnus Dei\n\nParticipants:\nCamilla Nylund | SOPRANO\nBirgit Remmert | ALTO\nChristian Elsner |TENOR\nRené Pape | BASS\nChorus of the Saxon State Opera Dresden\nMatthias Brauer | CHORUS MASTER\nDresden State Orchestra\nFabio Luisi | CONDUCTOR\n\nThe Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) with its high dome visible from afar is considered the landmark of the city of Dresden in Saxony. In the Second World War, this striking church was destroyed by bombs in February 1945 and existed for decades only as a ruin. From 1993 to 2005 it was rebuilt using the remaining rubble. Its reconstruction is a symbol of hope and reconciliation – and the magnificent church building with its unique blend of old and new bricks is intended to keep the memory of history alive.\n\nA work as festive as it is grand was chosen for the reopening concert. The Missa solemnis by Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 - 1827). The ‘Solemn Mass’ is considered one of the composer’s most important works, and Beethoven himself even called it his greatest work on several occasions. The Mass for four soloists, choir, orchestra and orgue in D major, Op. 123 was composed between 1819 and 1823, after Beethoven had already studied in detail the Latin text of the Mass and its various settings by other composers. The Missa solemnis reflects Beethoven’s struggle with religion and has a clearly confessional character. The individual parts of the mass are divided into five major compositional sections, giving the ‘Great Mass’ an almost symphonic aspect. This famous piece of church music demands a great deal from the vocal soloists, the choir and the large orchestra.\n\nBeethoven’s Missa solemnis at the official reopening concert of Dresden’s Frauenkirche in 2005: Experience a moving concert at a location with an eventful history.\n\nA Production of ZDF\nIn Cooperation with EuroArts Music International & ARTE\n© 2005 EuroArts\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlistlist=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#LudwigvanBeethoven #MissaSolemnis #churchmusic","Duration":"01:22:32","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"S8Yy0gSt-JE","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 1 | Margarita Höhenrieder, Staatskapelle Dresden & Fabio Luisi","Description":"Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major by Ludwig van Beethoven is Beethoven for piano virtuosos. Margarita Höhenrieder shines on the piano, accompanied by the Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden conducted by Fabio Luisi. The concert took place in 2008 at the Philharmonie im Gasteig Munich.\n\n(00:00) I. Allegro con brio\n(18:39) II Largo\n(29:50) III Rondo: Allegro scherzando\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770 - 1827) wrote seven piano concertos, five of which are numbered as opuses. The Piano Concerto in C major, Op. 15 is known as Piano Concerto No. 1, even though it was not the first concerto for piano that Beethoven wrote. First drafts for the Piano Concerto in C major date from 1793, a first complete transcription was available in late 1794 or early 1795, a new score existed before 1800 and finally the print appeared in 1801 after the solo part had been rewritten a second time. Beethoven probably performed an early version of the C major concerto himself in Vienna in 1795, where he is also thought to have performed a later version for the first time in 1800.\n\nBeethoven initially wrote his piano concertos primarily for himself. As a piano virtuoso, he wanted to show off his skills to an audience with the solo concertos; he was, after all, famous for his brilliant improvisations on the popular instrument.\n\nThere are similarities between the Piano Concerto in C major and Symphony No. 1, not only with respect to the period in which they were composed. In both works, the young Beethoven’s knack of bringing forth the most diverse musical emotions from a simple thematic idea is already evident. And both works are characterized by a festive tone in which virtuosity is celebrated to the highest degree.\n\nMargarita Höhenrieder discovered her love for the piano at an early age. She gave her first public performance at the age of seven in Munich’s Herkulessaal. She studied with Anna Stadler and Ludwig Hoffmann in Munich, and later with renowned American pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher in Baltimore.\n\nIn 1981, she won First Prize at the prestigious Busoni Competition in Bolzano, joining the ranks of other notable Busoni laureates such as Martha Argerich and Jörg Demus. At the age of 28, she became Germany's youngest piano professor when she was appointed to the University of Music in Würzburg. In 1991, she was appointed to the University of Music and Performing Arts in Munich.\n\nAs a soloist, Margarita Höhenrieder has performed with many of the world’s most celebrated conductors and orchestras, including Kirill Petrenko, Claudio Abbado, Lorin Maazel, James Levine, Ivor Bolton, Riccardo Chailly, and Fabio Luisi, as well as with major ensembles such as the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Munich Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra.\n\n© EuroArts Music International\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlistlist=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#LudwigvanBeethoven #PianoConcerto #MargaritaHöhenrieder","Duration":"00:38:46","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"279KL-eVnVM","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"BRAHMS Symphony No. 3 | Next Stage, Presented by PNC Bank","Description":"Fabio Luisi conducts\nDallas Symphony Orchestra\nMorton H.

The lack of success of the premiere resulted in years of struggle over how to present and program this weighty symphonic work. This process only came to an end in 1899 when the first symphony went to print. While working on it, Mahler had even at times assigned his orchestral symphony movement titles and the nickname ‘Titan’ (after the hero of Jean Paul’s novel of the same name), which in the end he decided not to use.\n\nDespite its traditional four-movement structure, at times Mahler’s First almost seems like a colorful, exuberant collage in which marches, fanfares, waltzes and folk songs abruptly alternate at times. As the main theme of the first movement, Mahler uses an instrumental version of the song ‘Ging heut’ morgen über’s Feld’, which he had taken from his first song cycle ‘Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen’. This joyous walk is framed by onomatopoeic sounds from nature, where listeners have the impression they are hearing French horns and birdcalls. The ‘musical wander’ then builds up to a triumphant finale. In the second movement, a coarse, powerful Ländler frames a sweetly wistful trio. This strident parody of folk music is reminiscent of an unbridled folk festival or busy fairground hustle and bustle. In contrast, the third movement begins as a funeral march, which turns out to be a minor-key version of the folk tune that became world-famous as the children’s song ‘Frère Jacques’. The funeral march theme is contrasted with distorted insertions of pleasing themes. Again, a song from Mahler’s first song cycle, this time ‘Die zwei blauen Augen’, provides the inspiration. In the fourth movement Mahler incorporates march music and other musical styles, and also revisits the theme of nature of the opening movement, although now it sounds more like a distant memory. The symphony culminates in a chorale that turns into a triumphant fanfare and concludes the thematic round. Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 is a magnificent orchestral work, probably unsurpassed in its theatricality and irony, in which the tragic and the grotesque are never far apart.\n\n© EuroArts Music International\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#GustavMahler #symphony #StaatskapelleDresden","Duration":"00:58:14","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"d51uaNKY6f0","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Malko Competition -
