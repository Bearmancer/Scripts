    "Description": "One of the most emblematic pieces of classical music ever: Mozart\u2019s Serenade No. 13 in G major (K. 525), widely known as \u2018Eine kleine Nachtmusik\u2019, performed by Members of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Sir Colin Davis. This concert took place in 1991 in the venerable ambiance of the Historischer Reichssaal Regensburg, Germany. May you be as entranced by Mozart\u2019s genius as Sir Colin Davis, who seems to take obvious pleasure in conducting this famous classic.\n\n(00:00) Coming on stage\n(00:11) I. Allegro \n(06:19) II. Romance (Andante) \n(12:25) III. Menuetto (Allegretto) \n(14:32) IV. Rondo (Allegro) \n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) composed the serenade \u2018Eine kleine Nachtmusik\u2019 in the summer of 1787, at the height of his success. While the piece was originally composed for two violins, a viola, a cello, and a double bass it is nowadays more commonly performed as an orchestral arrangement. \n\nOut of the many serenades, divertimenti, and cassations Mozart wrote during his lifetime, \u2018Eine kleine Nachtmusik\u2019 is doubtlessly his most famous work of chamber music. During the late 18th century, such light entertainment ensemble pieces enjoyed immense success and were often performed during social occasions, particularly in outdoor locations such as gardens and parks. \n\nThe four-piece Serenade No. 13 opens with an allegro in sonata form, followed by a slower, lyrical second movement and a minuet, and finishes on an energetically joyful rondo. The melodic lightness and effortlessness typical for this genre of music are present throughout all four movements. \n\nProduced by BR \u0026 BMG Classics\n\n\u00A9 BMG Classics 1991\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#WolfgangAmadeusMozart #EineKleineNachtmusik #mozartserenade",

It was the year I turned 16. I finished school, entered my first real job (yes: in a music shop) and was now even legally allowed to have sex. It was also the year in which my interest in the music of my fellow countrymen, the Dutch composers you almost never heard anything from, became really serious, this mainly through two events that would leave their marks on my life from then on. \nIn June it was the first performance of the completed orchestrated version of Diepenbrock\u0027s Mass, which I now know put my existence on a different and definitely higher plane.\nIn November an event of likewise spectacularity took place, the premiere of Peter Schat\u0027s First Symphony.\nIt was a huge event for a number of reasons. Most important of course the fact that Peter Schat, of all people, had written a... \u0022symphony\u0022 - a musical form thought by just about anybody involved in contemporary music to have become extinct, something of the past. \u0022Nobody writes symphonies anymore.\u0022\n\n(more to follow)\n====\n\nThe picture quality of this film is not really smashing to say the last. It comes from a Betamax tape that very soon will be 40 years old.\n====\n\n!! CONCERT HALL, COMPOSER PERFORMERS,TELEVISION BROADCAST AND PRESERVATION WERE ALL FINANCED WITH\nPUBLIC MONEY !!",
