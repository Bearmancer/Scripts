Allegro moderato\nA composi\u00E7\u00E3o da Sinfonia n\u00BA 2 em r\u00E9 maior, Op. 43, foi iniciada no inverno de 1901 em Rapallo, It\u00E1lia, logo ap\u00F3s a estreia bem-sucedida do popular \u201CFinlandia\u201D, e conclu\u00EDda em 1902 na Finl\u00E2ndia. Sibelius disse: \u0022Minha segunda sinfonia \u00E9 uma confiss\u00E3o da alma.\u0022 O bar\u00E3o Axel Carpelan, que deu o nome ao conhecido poema sinf\u00F4nico de Sibelius, \u201CFinlandia\u201D, escreveu ao compositor logo ap\u00F3s sua estreia de sucesso: \u0022Voc\u00EA est\u00E1 preso em casa h\u00E1 um bom tempo, \u00E9 hora de voc\u00EA viajar.

Embora o Bar\u00E3o Carpelan n\u00E3o tivesse dinheiro para financiar essa viagem, ele levantou fundos suficientes para Sibelius ficar em uma vila nas montanhas perto de Rapallo, It\u00E1lia, onde o compositor anotou as primeiras notas da sinfonia.",
