[{"Title":"Beethoven: Symphony No. 6 Pastoral | Sylvain Cambreling & Kammerorchester Basel","Description":"Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6 – the Pastoral Symphony – is one of the music’s most iconic depictions of nature. Here, it’s being performed at the 2021 Beethovenfest Bonn by the Kammerorchester Basel, conducted by Sylvain Cambreling, in the World Conference Center (WCCB). \n\n(00:00) Opening\n(00:23) I. Allegro ma non troppo: Erwachen heiterer Empfindungen bei der Ankunft auf dem Lande (Awakening of cheerful feelings upon arrival in the country)\n(11:39) II. Andante molto mosso: Szene am Bach (Scene at the brook)\n(23:42) III. Allegro: Lustiges Zusammensein der Landleute (Merry gathering of country folk)\n(29:05) IV. Allegro: Gewitter, Sturm (Thunderstorm; Storm)\n(32:56) V. Allegretto: Hirtengesang. Frohe und dankbare Gefühle nach dem Sturm (Shepherds' song; cheerful and thankful feelings after the storm)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) completed his Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68 in 1808. At the time, the musician was already known for his breaking with traditional patterns, and this symphony was no exception. A great lover of walks in the countryside, he came up with the idea of representing nature through composition; rural scenes and pastoral life were to receive musical depictions. \n\nThe composer concerned himself not at all with the direct representation of specific natural events, however – it was ideas and sensations that were to serve as inspirations for the composition. Later, this new approach – in which the musical form had receded into the background – was called a ‘symphony of ideas’. Beethoven’s Sixth contains five movements. In addition to the usual tempo indications, the composer provided descriptive titles for each. \n\nThe symphony begins with an ‘awakening of cheerful feelings on arrival in the countryside’, to be taken at an Allegro ma non troppo tempo – ‘fast, but not exceedingly so’. \n\nThis first movement of Beethoven's Sixth involves a number of tempos, moods, feelings, and effects. One thing is notably absent, however – that driving thrust so typical for Beethoven; the struggle and passion of striving towards the attainment of a goal. Instead, the primary theme repeats. In parts of the first movement, time seems to slow down – and even stand still. The composer himself said of the first movement that it ought to be \"More an expression of feeling than tone-painting.\" \n\nThe symphony’s second movement evokes images of ripples on a creek and birdsong. To heighten the impression, Beethoven added the description ‘scene at the brook’ to the tempo heading Andante molto mosso – ‘as though walking, very moving’. Beethoven rarely explained his music, but in this case, he remarked: \"It's left to the listener to figure out the situations. Anyone who has any idea of life in the countryside can discern the composer's intent even without titles or headings.\" \n\nIn his notes for the musicians, Beethoven goes into greater detail, indicating in the score that the calls of the nightingale, the quail and the cuckoo are to be rendered by the flute, the oboe and two clarinets. The final three movements begin with a 'merry gathering of country folk', with the tempo called for being Allegro – ‘quick and bright’. \n\nAltogether, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6 anticipates what later would become known as ‘program music’ –  music that describes a situation or tells a story. At the merry gathering we can make out an oom-pah-pah village band which is not quite playing together, rendering it all the more boisterous as if to make up for it. \n\n\"My decree,\" wrote Ludwig van Beethoven: \"Stay in the countryside. My unfortunate hearing problem doesn't plague me here. It's as though, in the country, every tree was speaking to me. Holy, holy! Who can express it all? Sweet quietude of the forest!\" \n\nThat same sweet quietude comes to an abrupt end in the fourth movement, with the arrival of a ‘thunderstorm’, to be taken at a fast clip – Allegro. It's the shortest yet most dramatic movement of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony. Thunder, screeching wind and a downpour are all readily invoked. \n\nFollowing the country folk’s merriment and the storm comes the finale of Beethoven's Sixth; a ‘shepherds’ song’ of ‘cheerful and thankful feelings after the storm’. This closing part of the piece is characterized by fairly brisk pace – Allegretto.\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#Beethoven #Symphony6 #PastoralSymphony","Duration":"00:44:02","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"sRt24rQ2hJM","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Egmont Overture, Op. 84 (2018 Remastered Version)","Description":"Provided to YouTube by Sony Classical\n\nEgmont Overture, Op. 84 (2018 Remastered Version) · George Szell · Ludwig van Beethoven · The Cleveland Orchestra\n\nSzell Conducts Beethoven Overtures\n\n℗ 1967 Sony Music Entertainment\n\nReleased on: 2018-07-27\n\nConductor: George Szell\nOrchestra: The Cleveland Orchestra\nComposer: Ludwig van Beethoven\nProducer: Paul Myers\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.","Duration":"00:08:35","ChannelName":"George Szell - Topic","VideoId":"f0TZgjgfWT8","ChannelId":"UCLw6qf8gr7kkWTlAYy6oAHg"},{"Title":"Hussite Overture, Op. 67, B. 132","Description":"Provided to YouTube by NAXOS of America\n\nHussite Overture, Op. 67, B. 132 · Rafael Kubelík\n\nHenryk Szeryng: Dvorak & Brahms\n\n℗ 2016 Orfeo\n\nReleased on: 2016-01-01\n\nConductor: Rafael Kubelík\nOrchestra: Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks\nComposer: Antonín Dvořák\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.","Duration":"00:13:15","ChannelName":"Rafael Kubelík - Topic","VideoId":"xD3P90OL8iA","ChannelId":"UCTfOG7A5Jp3V_xWVsyvil5A"},{"Title":"Marche slave, Op. 31, TH 45","Description":"Provided to YouTube by Sony Classical/Legacy\n\nMarche slave, Op. 31, TH 45 · Leonard Bernstein · New York Philharmonic Orchestra · Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\nTchaikovsky: 1812 Overture; Marche Slave; Romeo and Juliet; Capriccio Italien; Hamlet (Expanded Edition)\n\n℗ 1963 Sony Music Entertainment\n\nReleased on: 2004-02-24\n\nProducer: John McClure\n\nAuto-generated by YouTube.","Duration":"00:09:33","ChannelName":"Leonard Bernstein - Topic","VideoId":"kVOKlJ1iMZI","ChannelId":"UCKgPYOpEUNC_GjQcFhg674w"},{"Title":"Symphony No. 41 in C Major, K. 551 \"Jupiter\": I.
