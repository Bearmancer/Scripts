    "Title": "Beethoven: Symphony No. 6 Pastoral | Sylvain Cambreling \u0026 Kammerorchester Basel",
    "Description": "Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 6 \u2013 the Pastoral Symphony \u2013 is one of the music\u2019s most iconic depictions of nature. Here, it\u2019s being performed at the 2021 Beethovenfest Bonn by the Kammerorchester Basel, conducted by Sylvain Cambreling, in the World Conference Center (WCCB). \n\n(00:00) Opening\n(00:23) I. Allegro ma non troppo: Erwachen heiterer Empfindungen bei der Ankunft auf dem Lande (Awakening of cheerful feelings upon arrival in the country)\n(11:39) II. Andante molto mosso: Szene am Bach (Scene at the brook)\n(23:42) III. Allegro: Lustiges Zusammensein der Landleute (Merry gathering of country folk)\n(29:05) IV. Allegro: Gewitter, Sturm (Thunderstorm; Storm)\n(32:56) V. Allegretto: Hirtengesang. Frohe und dankbare Gef\u00FChle nach dem Sturm (Shepherds\u0027 song; cheerful and thankful feelings after the storm)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) completed his Symphony No. 6 in F major, Op. 68 in 1808. At the time, the musician was already known for his breaking with traditional patterns, and this symphony was no exception. A great lover of walks in the countryside, he came up with the idea of representing nature through composition; rural scenes and pastoral life were to receive musical depictions. \n\nThe composer concerned himself not at all with the direct representation of specific natural events, however \u2013 it was ideas and sensations that were to serve as inspirations for the composition. Later, this new approach \u2013 in which the musical form had receded into the background \u2013 was called a \u2018symphony of ideas\u2019. Beethoven\u2019s Sixth contains five movements. In addition to the usual tempo indications, the composer provided descriptive titles for each. \n\nThe symphony begins with an \u2018awakening of cheerful feelings on arrival in the countryside\u2019, to be taken at an Allegro ma non troppo tempo \u2013 \u2018fast, but not exceedingly so\u2019. \n\nThis first movement of Beethoven\u0027s Sixth involves a number of tempos, moods, feelings, and effects. One thing is notably absent, however \u2013 that driving thrust so typical for Beethoven; the struggle and passion of striving towards the attainment of a goal. Instead, the primary theme repeats. In parts of the first movement, time seems to slow down \u2013 and even stand still. The composer himself said of the first movement that it ought to be \u0022More an expression of feeling than tone-painting.\u0022 \n\nThe symphony\u2019s second movement evokes images of ripples on a creek and birdsong. To heighten the impression, Beethoven added the description \u2018scene at the brook\u2019 to the tempo heading Andante molto mosso \u2013 \u2018as though walking, very moving\u2019. Beethoven rarely explained his music, but in this case, he remarked: \u0022It\u0027s left to the listener to figure out the situations. Anyone who has any idea of life in the countryside can discern the composer\u0027s intent even without titles or headings.\u0022 \n\nIn his notes for the musicians, Beethoven goes into greater detail, indicating in the score that the calls of the nightingale, the quail and the cuckoo are to be rendered by the flute, the oboe and two clarinets. The final three movements begin with a \u0027merry gathering of country folk\u0027, with the tempo called for being Allegro \u2013 \u2018quick and bright\u2019. \n\nAltogether, Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 6 anticipates what later would become known as \u2018program music\u2019 \u2013  music that describes a situation or tells a story. At the merry gathering we can make out an oom-pah-pah village band which is not quite playing together, rendering it all the more boisterous as if to make up for it. \n\n\u0022My decree,\u0022 wrote Ludwig van Beethoven: \u0022Stay in the countryside. My unfortunate hearing problem doesn\u0027t plague me here. It\u0027s as though, in the country, every tree was speaking to me. Holy, holy! Who can express it all? Sweet quietude of the forest!\u0022 \n\nThat same sweet quietude comes to an abrupt end in the fourth movement, with the arrival of a \u2018thunderstorm\u2019, to be taken at a fast clip \u2013 Allegro. It\u0027s the shortest yet most dramatic movement of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s Sixth Symphony. Thunder, screeching wind and a downpour are all readily invoked. \n\nFollowing the country folk\u2019s merriment and the storm comes the finale of Beethoven\u0027s Sixth; a \u2018shepherds\u2019 song\u2019 of \u2018cheerful and thankful feelings after the storm\u2019. This closing part of the piece is characterized by fairly brisk pace \u2013 Allegretto.\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#Beethoven #Symphony6 #PastoralSymphony",
