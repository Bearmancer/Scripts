    "Title": "(Garrick Ohlsson | 2018 | Live) Busoni: Piano Concerto in C major, Op.39",
    "Description": "Now when we\u0027ve entered both a new year and a new decade I\u0027ve been asking myself that question... What was the greatest musical experience of the 2010s? I have to say that the overwhelming dominant has been Sokolov, who I was often at odds with during the 00s but who I now the last 10 years have been bowled over by at almost every concert - both for the quality of the artistry, the exemplary musicianship, and the near unbelievable piano playing.\n\nAfter some consideration however my pick will have to be this. I traveled to my old home country specifically to attend this performance, and while I expected a mighty experience to finally hear this monumental concerto performed live, it swept me off my feet in a way I never anticipated. It\u0027s unusual in so many ways - not only because of the gigantic scope of the composition, both in length and vision, but also because of the choral finale and that the piano acts as an integral part of the orchestra rather than a solo instrument contrasted against it, as is otherwise customary. Over the course of 70 minutes you\u0027re taken on a wild ride through both humanity and the world. From the proud, seafaring first movement, to the jungles of the second, the severe and tumultuous core of the work in the third, the humorous and rapidly shifting kaleidoscope of the fourth, to the profound conclusion in the fifth, where harmony finally reigns and where the choir almost seems to stand as a symbol for us as a species. In my mind it is no doubt one of the grandest achievements of late romanticism, and one of the most remarkable piano concertos ever written. Not as finely wrought as the Brahms-2 or Rach-3, say, but richer in ideas and grander in scope than anything else found in the genre.\n\nNeedless to say about a romantic work of these proportions it puts enormous demands on everyone involved in executing it. From the pianist\u0027s perspective you first of all need considerable chops and stamina just to be able to play it - it was written by the man who thought there were too few notes in La Campanella after all - but thanks to the piano\u0027s role you must also have the sound resources required to counterbalance an entire orchestra. With Ohlsson behind the keys we had nothing to fear in that department. He drew a bright, massive and crystal clear sonority from the Steinway throughout the concerto, and followed effortlessly wherever Busoni and Oramo took him. I leave out the pianism because Ohlsson did as well. He gave no hint to his audience of the tremendous technical obstacles he was conquering, and he never drew attention to the piano playing per se. Indeed, the spotlight rather fell on the Stockholm Philharmonics who did some blinding playing along the way - and not least Sakari Oramo who in many ways was the real star of the evening.\n\nGranted, this is not an easy concerto to get in to, but the effort involved pays off thousand fold once you do, and for those new to it I know of no better introduction than the present performance.\n\n\nBusoni: Piano Concerto in C major, Op.39 (BV 247) (1904)\n00:00 - I.

    "Title": "CHARLES E. IVES: \u0022Symphony No.4\u0022 (1910-16). City of Birmingham SO / Sakari Oramo (rec.2004)",
    "Description": "CHARLES E. IVES (1874-1951): \u0022Symphony No.4\u0022 (1910-24). City of Birmingham SO / Sakari Oramo (rec. July 27, 2004)\nSymphony No.4  was written between 1910 and the mid-1920s (the 2nd movement \u0022Comedy\u0022 was the last to be composed, most likely in 1924). It is notable for its multilayered complexity\u2014typically requiring two conductors in performance-and for its large and varied orchestration. Combining elements and techniques of Ives\u0027s previous compositional work, this has been called \u0022one of his most definitive works\u0022; Ives\u0027 biographer, Jan Swafford, has called it \u0022Ives\u0027s climactic masterpiece\u0022.\nIt is in four movements: 1) Prelude: Maestoso (0:07) - 2) Comedy: Allegretto ( 3:31)\nFugue: Andante moderato con moto (14:44)  -4) Finale: Very slowly\u2013Largo maestoso (21:22). Although the symphony requires a very large orchestra, it lasts about 30 minutes.\nI. Prelude: Maestoso.  Wikisource has original text related to this article \u0022Watchman, Tell Us of the Night\u0022.This movement and the 2nd mov. were first performed in the Town Hall, New York City, on January 29, 1927, by 50 members of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on a Pro Musica International Referendum Concert conducted by Eugene Goossens. While 50 players are sufficient for the chamber-like scoring of the 1st mov., the 2nd in reality requires almost twice as many players, yet this was Ives\u0027s only experience of hearing any parts of the Symphony performed live. In contrast to Ives\u0027s other works for large orchestra, which begin in quiet and meditative moods, the Prelude starts with a strong, maestoso, fortissimo bassline, immediately followed by a rising trumpet fanfare. A quiet passage follows. The mov. ends with chorus singing John Bowring\u0027s Epiphany hymn \u0022Watchman, Tell Us of the Night\u0022. Unlike the bold beginning, the movement dies away, quadruple-pianissimo, at the end.\nII. Comedy: Allegretto. Ives bases this \u0022Comedy\u0022 movement on Hawthorne\u0027s story \u0022The Celestial Railroad\u0022, itself a trope on John Bunyan\u0027s Pilgrim\u0027s Progress. It is an orchestral expansion\u2014not merely a simple orchestration\u2014of Ives\u0027s piano solo, The Celestial Railroad (ca. 1924). It is his most extreme essay in overlapping thematic material, found also in his \u0022Holidays Symphony\u0022, but is most complex in its use of multimetrics and temporal dysynchronies, and is compositionally his most complex orchestral work. Tunes quoted include \u0022In the Sweet By-and-By\u0022, \u0022Beulah Land\u0022, \u0022Marching Through Georgia\u0022, \u0022Ye Christian Heralds\u0022, \u0022Jesus, Lover of my Soul\u0022 and \u0022Nearer, My God, to Thee\u0022. The disjunctive metrical and temporal complexity of this mov. requires at least one additional conductor. The music builds to several riotous climaxes before ebbing away.In Henry Bellamann\u0027s program note to the 1927 premiere of the 1st and 2nd movements is described this: \u00ABThe aesthetic program of the work is that of many of the greatest literary and musical masterpieces of the world -the searching questions of What? and Why? which the spirit of man asks of life. This is particularly the sense of the prelude. The... succeeding movements are the diverse answers in which existence replies\u00BB.\nIII. Fugue: Andante moderato con moto. An arrangement of this mov. by composer Bernard Herrmann was performed in New York on May 10, 1933, but Ives\u0027s version was not performed until the integral premiere of the entire Symphony on April 26, 1965. It is a mild orchestral expansion of a student fugue exercise Ives composed during his years at Yale University; in its orchestral form, it ends with a brief quotation of \u0022Joy to the World\u0022. According to Elliott Carter, the movement \u0022is about 75% the same as the first movement of [Ives\u0027] First String Quartet\u0022 and \u00ABhas a few irregular bar lengths, polyrhythms, and dissonances added especially at the expanded climax near the end\u00BB. Ives called it \u0022an expression of the reaction of life into formalism and ritualism\u0022. Paradoxically, because of its juxtaposition with the other three harmonically, tonally and rhythmically complex movements,.\nIV. Finale: Very slowly \u2013 Largo maestoso. \nIn his Memos, Ives said: \u00ABthis mov. seems to me the best, compared with the other movements, or for that matter with any other thing that I\u0027ve done...The last mov. is an apotheosis of the preceding content, in terms that have something to do with the reality of existence and its religious experience\u00BB.\nThe 4th mov. is distinguished by a rhythmic plan in which there is a division between the main orchestra and a separate group of percussion; the two groups play in precise temporal ratios to one another, and obtaining the temporal ratios between the two groups is one of the chief challenges of performing the movement. Also novel in the symphony is the use of quarter tones, heard both in the strings as well as in a dedicated quarter-tone piano that assumes 24 notes per octave. In the 2nd mov., the quarter-tone piano noodles a filigree pattern in quarter and regular tones to accompany a solo violin that intones the hymn \u0022Beulah Land\u0022.",

    "Description": "The Melartin Society\u0027s new performing edition of the Third Symphony differs remarkably from the version adopted by Leonid Grin for his well-known and much loved 1990\u0027s recording with the Tampere Philharmonic. It\u0027s around ten minutes longer, much of the new material seemingly in the first movement. Throughout the work instrumentation is more detailed, complex, sophisticated, ambitious, original. There are points in the \u0022Grin Version\u0022 that seemed curiously weak or disjointed ~ now they are complete as originally intended, they make perfect sense, raising the symphony to an even higher level. Apparently the Third Symphony needed rather less reconstruction work than the others, suggesting other symphonies are going to sound very different indeed!\n This is a live performance 27th April 2012, recorded from a radio broadcast.  The Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra were conducted by Sakari Oramo. As with most live performances there is a certain amount of coughing from the audience, there are also some blips \u0026 distortions in the recording, but the sound is generally very good.\n\nMELARTIN SOCIETY NEW EDITIONS....\n\u0022In 2006, the Erkki Melartin Society launched an editing and clean-copying project for Melartin\u2019s symphonies. The aim was to promote their performing, and help them become a living part of the music culture in Finland. Besides the works of Jean Sibelius, the public of today should be given a possibility of hearing the more lyrical symphonic music of Melartin, which has been more influenced by the Finnish folk songs, the Finnish scenery, and the idyll of summer.\nThe editing and clean-copying project has also the objective of facilitating the work of symphony orchestras, since the autograph scores and handwritten orchestral parts have mistakes, incoherencies and interpretation problems. Until now, orchestras and conductors have made a considerable effort in turning the\ncontents of sometimes unreadable photocopies of Melartin\u0027s scores into performable shape. In addition, the works have sometimes been radically shortened in recordings and historical radio broadcasts. Therefore, it has been considered important to produce the orchestral materials in the forms in which the composer has originally written them\u0022.

In a composer\u2019s career, this manifested as a balancing act between the requirements of national and international music life. \n\nAnton\u00EDn Dvo\u0159\u00E1k\u2019s (1841\u20131904) career is one example of this. He was interested in national topics, and he enriched his musical colour palette with folk music. However, Dvo\u0159\u00E1k had international career aspirations, which in turn required becoming mainstream. In German-speaking countries and England, symphony was seen as the crown jewel of art music. Dvo\u0159\u00E1k wrote nine symphonies inspired by the examples of Beethoven and Brahms. The eighth symphony (1889) features a new, more poetic approach by the composer, which manifests itself as themes of folk music and a more rhapsodic treatment of the strict principles of symphony form. On the other hand, the composer created consistency that kept the package unified through motivation and, above all, through the way he processed the rhythm. \n\nLeo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek (1854\u20131928) also succeeded internationally, especially after his first opera, Jenufa. The First World War broke down Austria-Hungary, whose ruins gave birth to several nation states with their own national institutions. In fact, Jan\u00E1\u010Dek composed a number of pieces at the request and honour of the Czech army, creating traditions for new institutions and strengthening national self-esteem. In the first half of the 20th century, folk music became the foundation of national art music cultures, especially in Eastern Europe. Jan\u00E1\u010Dek succeeded in creating very original melodic language that combines modernism and folk music. \n\nThe programme of the Sibelius Academy Symphony Orchestra concert is complemented by Beethoven\u2019s piano concerto. \n\nThe concert will be organised in cooperation with the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland music university.",
