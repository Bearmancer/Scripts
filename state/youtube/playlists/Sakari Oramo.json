[{"Title":"(Garrick Ohlsson | 2018 | Live) Busoni: Piano Concerto in C major, Op.39","Description":"Now when we've entered both a new year and a new decade I've been asking myself that question... What was the greatest musical experience of the 2010s? I have to say that the overwhelming dominant has been Sokolov, who I was often at odds with during the 00s but who I now the last 10 years have been bowled over by at almost every concert - both for the quality of the artistry, the exemplary musicianship, and the near unbelievable piano playing.\n\nAfter some consideration however my pick will have to be this. I traveled to my old home country specifically to attend this performance, and while I expected a mighty experience to finally hear this monumental concerto performed live, it swept me off my feet in a way I never anticipated. It's unusual in so many ways - not only because of the gigantic scope of the composition, both in length and vision, but also because of the choral finale and that the piano acts as an integral part of the orchestra rather than a solo instrument contrasted against it, as is otherwise customary. Over the course of 70 minutes you're taken on a wild ride through both humanity and the world. From the proud, seafaring first movement, to the jungles of the second, the severe and tumultuous core of the work in the third, the humorous and rapidly shifting kaleidoscope of the fourth, to the profound conclusion in the fifth, where harmony finally reigns and where the choir almost seems to stand as a symbol for us as a species. In my mind it is no doubt one of the grandest achievements of late romanticism, and one of the most remarkable piano concertos ever written. Not as finely wrought as the Brahms-2 or Rach-3, say, but richer in ideas and grander in scope than anything else found in the genre.\n\nNeedless to say about a romantic work of these proportions it puts enormous demands on everyone involved in executing it. From the pianist's perspective you first of all need considerable chops and stamina just to be able to play it - it was written by the man who thought there were too few notes in La Campanella after all - but thanks to the piano's role you must also have the sound resources required to counterbalance an entire orchestra. With Ohlsson behind the keys we had nothing to fear in that department. He drew a bright, massive and crystal clear sonority from the Steinway throughout the concerto, and followed effortlessly wherever Busoni and Oramo took him. I leave out the pianism because Ohlsson did as well. He gave no hint to his audience of the tremendous technical obstacles he was conquering, and he never drew attention to the piano playing per se. Indeed, the spotlight rather fell on the Stockholm Philharmonics who did some blinding playing along the way - and not least Sakari Oramo who in many ways was the real star of the evening.\n\nGranted, this is not an easy concerto to get in to, but the effort involved pays off thousand fold once you do, and for those new to it I know of no better introduction than the present performance.\n\n\nBusoni: Piano Concerto in C major, Op.39 (BV 247) (1904)\n00:00 - I.

City of Birmingham SO / Sakari Oramo (rec.2004)","Description":"CHARLES E. IVES (1874-1951): \"Symphony No.4\" (1910-24). City of Birmingham SO / Sakari Oramo (rec. July 27, 2004)\nSymphony No.4  was written between 1910 and the mid-1920s (the 2nd movement \"Comedy\" was the last to be composed, most likely in 1924). It is notable for its multilayered complexity—typically requiring two conductors in performance-and for its large and varied orchestration. Combining elements and techniques of Ives's previous compositional work, this has been called \"one of his most definitive works\"; Ives' biographer, Jan Swafford, has called it \"Ives's climactic masterpiece\".\nIt is in four movements: 1) Prelude: Maestoso (0:07) - 2) Comedy: Allegretto ( 3:31)\nFugue: Andante moderato con moto (14:44)  -4) Finale: Very slowly–Largo maestoso (21:22). Although the symphony requires a very large orchestra, it lasts about 30 minutes.\nI. Prelude: Maestoso.  Wikisource has original text related to this article \"Watchman, Tell Us of the Night\".This movement and the 2nd mov. were first performed in the Town Hall, New York City, on January 29, 1927, by 50 members of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on a Pro Musica International Referendum Concert conducted by Eugene Goossens. While 50 players are sufficient for the chamber-like scoring of the 1st mov., the 2nd in reality requires almost twice as many players, yet this was Ives's only experience of hearing any parts of the Symphony performed live. In contrast to Ives's other works for large orchestra, which begin in quiet and meditative moods, the Prelude starts with a strong, maestoso, fortissimo bassline, immediately followed by a rising trumpet fanfare. A quiet passage follows. The mov. ends with chorus singing John Bowring's Epiphany hymn \"Watchman, Tell Us of the Night\". Unlike the bold beginning, the movement dies away, quadruple-pianissimo, at the end.\nII. Comedy: Allegretto. Ives bases this \"Comedy\" movement on Hawthorne's story \"The Celestial Railroad\", itself a trope on John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. It is an orchestral expansion—not merely a simple orchestration—of Ives's piano solo, The Celestial Railroad (ca. 1924). It is his most extreme essay in overlapping thematic material, found also in his \"Holidays Symphony\", but is most complex in its use of multimetrics and temporal dysynchronies, and is compositionally his most complex orchestral work. Tunes quoted include \"In the Sweet By-and-By\", \"Beulah Land\", \"Marching Through Georgia\", \"Ye Christian Heralds\", \"Jesus, Lover of my Soul\" and \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\". The disjunctive metrical and temporal complexity of this mov. requires at least one additional conductor. The music builds to several riotous climaxes before ebbing away.In Henry Bellamann's program note to the 1927 premiere of the 1st and 2nd movements is described this: «The aesthetic program of the work is that of many of the greatest literary and musical masterpieces of the world -the searching questions of What? and Why? which the spirit of man asks of life. This is particularly the sense of the prelude. The... succeeding movements are the diverse answers in which existence replies».\nIII. Fugue: Andante moderato con moto. An arrangement of this mov. by composer Bernard Herrmann was performed in New York on May 10, 1933, but Ives's version was not performed until the integral premiere of the entire Symphony on April 26, 1965. It is a mild orchestral expansion of a student fugue exercise Ives composed during his years at Yale University; in its orchestral form, it ends with a brief quotation of \"Joy to the World\". According to Elliott Carter, the movement \"is about 75% the same as the first movement of [Ives'] First String Quartet\" and «has a few irregular bar lengths, polyrhythms, and dissonances added especially at the expanded climax near the end». Ives called it \"an expression of the reaction of life into formalism and ritualism\". Paradoxically, because of its juxtaposition with the other three harmonically, tonally and rhythmically complex movements,.\nIV. Finale: Very slowly – Largo maestoso. \nIn his Memos, Ives said: «this mov. seems to me the best, compared with the other movements, or for that matter with any other thing that I've done...The last mov. is an apotheosis of the preceding content, in terms that have something to do with the reality of existence and its religious experience».\nThe 4th mov. is distinguished by a rhythmic plan in which there is a division between the main orchestra and a separate group of percussion; the two groups play in precise temporal ratios to one another, and obtaining the temporal ratios between the two groups is one of the chief challenges of performing the movement. Also novel in the symphony is the use of quarter tones, heard both in the strings as well as in a dedicated quarter-tone piano that assumes 24 notes per octave. In the 2nd mov., the quarter-tone piano noodles a filigree pattern in quarter and regular tones to accompany a solo violin that intones the hymn \"Beulah Land\".","Duration":"00:29:33","ChannelName":"Guido Molinari","VideoId":"LNLPVCqwmGE","ChannelId":"UCO-1HoFd0qWSIh5EpYxxZrg"},{"Title":"Dieter Ammann - Piano Concerto (\"Gran Toccata\") (World Première)","Description":"Andreas Haefliger (piano), BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sakari Oramo\nhttp://5against4.com/2019/08/23/proms-2019-dieter-ammann-piano-concerto-gran-toccata-world-premiere/","Duration":"00:31:51","ChannelName":"fiveagainstfour","VideoId":"E5JWHjZdEAs","ChannelId":"UCOV3RqrUtxMX3xPKVLsAI6g"},{"Title":"Elgar - Sinfonie Nr. 2 | Sakari Oramo | NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchester","Description":"Edward Elgars Zweite Sinfonie in Es-Dur, gespielt vom NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchester  nter Leitung von Sakari Oramo.

It's around ten minutes longer, much of the new material seemingly in the first movement. Throughout the work instrumentation is more detailed, complex, sophisticated, ambitious, original. There are points in the \"Grin Version\" that seemed curiously weak or disjointed ~ now they are complete as originally intended, they make perfect sense, raising the symphony to an even higher level. Apparently the Third Symphony needed rather less reconstruction work than the others, suggesting other symphonies are going to sound very different indeed!\n This is a live performance 27th April 2012, recorded from a radio broadcast.  The Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra were conducted by Sakari Oramo. As with most live performances there is a certain amount of coughing from the audience, there are also some blips & distortions in the recording, but the sound is generally very good.\n\nMELARTIN SOCIETY NEW EDITIONS....\n\"In 2006, the Erkki Melartin Society launched an editing and clean-copying project for Melartin’s symphonies. The aim was to promote their performing, and help them become a living part of the music culture in Finland. Besides the works of Jean Sibelius, the public of today should be given a possibility of hearing the more lyrical symphonic music of Melartin, which has been more influenced by the Finnish folk songs, the Finnish scenery, and the idyll of summer.\nThe editing and clean-copying project has also the objective of facilitating the work of symphony orchestras, since the autograph scores and handwritten orchestral parts have mistakes, incoherencies and interpretation problems. Until now, orchestras and conductors have made a considerable effort in turning the\ncontents of sometimes unreadable photocopies of Melartin's scores into performable shape. In addition, the works have sometimes been radically shortened in recordings and historical radio broadcasts. Therefore, it has been considered important to produce the orchestral materials in the forms in which the composer has originally written them\".

In a composer’s career, this manifested as a balancing act between the requirements of national and international music life. \n\nAntonín Dvořák’s (1841–1904) career is one example of this. He was interested in national topics, and he enriched his musical colour palette with folk music. However, Dvořák had international career aspirations, which in turn required becoming mainstream. In German-speaking countries and England, symphony was seen as the crown jewel of art music. Dvořák wrote nine symphonies inspired by the examples of Beethoven and Brahms. The eighth symphony (1889) features a new, more poetic approach by the composer, which manifests itself as themes of folk music and a more rhapsodic treatment of the strict principles of symphony form. On the other hand, the composer created consistency that kept the package unified through motivation and, above all, through the way he processed the rhythm. \n\nLeoš Janáček (1854–1928) also succeeded internationally, especially after his first opera, Jenufa. The First World War broke down Austria-Hungary, whose ruins gave birth to several nation states with their own national institutions. In fact, Janáček composed a number of pieces at the request and honour of the Czech army, creating traditions for new institutions and strengthening national self-esteem. In the first half of the 20th century, folk music became the foundation of national art music cultures, especially in Eastern Europe. Janáček succeeded in creating very original melodic language that combines modernism and folk music. \n\nThe programme of the Sibelius Academy Symphony Orchestra concert is complemented by Beethoven’s piano concerto. \n\nThe concert will be organised in cooperation with the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland music university.","Duration":"01:52:57","ChannelName":"Uniarts Helsinki","VideoId":"AbVke7Pq3ms","ChannelId":"UChhYbbQnycWNe45uKiRPkag"},{"Title":"Sibelius: Finlandia (Prom 75)","Description":"Music by Sibelius marks the 100th anniversary of Finnish Independence.
