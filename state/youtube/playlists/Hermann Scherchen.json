But let’s point out some really good things about this performance, Scherchen’s first American appearance. We get to hear Gil Johnson, who had retired and been replaced by Frank Kaderabek by the time RCA commercially recorded Philadelphia in the Mahler 5 in 1977.  (Many consider Kaderabek’s characteristic timbre a demerit in that performance.) We get to hear Philly rising to the insane tempo demands — careening from largo to prestissimo and back again, none provided for in the score — of a conductor with an idiosyncratic view of how the M5 should sound.  We get to hear the tam tams in the first movement, loud and proud. Philadelphia has commercially recorded in house the M5 under Eschenbach and Yannick, both downloadable. Of the three available commercial issues, I personally think Yannick’s edges out the others. He pushes the PO in the scherzo in particular, thank goodness not to the cartoon proportions here, and boy do the players deliver.","Duration":"01:06:02","ChannelName":"Peter Kohn","VideoId":"d5im04T6AqA","ChannelId":"UCPjypaqxlfR5LrCJq3j1Pnw"},{"Title":"Mahler Symphony #7 (Song of the Night) - Scherchen, Toronto Symphony (live,1965)","Description":"As someone who loves both Toronto and Mahler, this is a treasured performance.","Duration":"01:09:53","ChannelName":"Digital Classics","VideoId":"ZIQMuf8Z3MI","ChannelId":"UCJfA71XobkBsUPSsz8BKnQA"},{"Title":"Mahler: Symphony No 6 \"Tragic\" (1960) Scherchen","Description":"Gustav Mahler \nSymphony No 6 \"Tragic\"\n\n1.

Allegro moderato-Allegro energico\n\nHermann Scherchen, conductor\nLeipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra\n\nRecorded Live in 1960\n\nScherchen, alas, did not leave a recording of the 6th symphony with the complete score. The present recording is from a live performance. His interpretation of the score is one of the fastest, but it is not without some extraordinary moments in musical terms. In  the 1950s and 60s a conductor was blazing New Trails with Mahler's lesser-known symphonies, and consensus was very different than it is today.\n\nThe symphony itself puzzled earlier audiences, and the origin of the \"Tragic\" title is unclear. Mahler composed the symphony during one of the happiest times in his life. There has also been a controversy about the order of the inner movements. The present edition is in the more accepted order of \"Andante-Scherzo\".\n\nAlthough critics and audiences were unconvinced at first, some, like Webern and Berg saw the 6th as a masterpiece. The symphony has become very popular over the last 40 years or so.","Duration":"00:53:50","ChannelName":"Private Reserve","VideoId":"iVj8PBhBND0","ChannelId":"UC2inKhUL9KMBUsLoUtLB2Gg"},{"Title":"Mahler: Symphony No. 6 [Scherchen]","Description":"Gustav Mahler: Symphony No. 6   ///   MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hermann Scherchen   ///   Recorded in 1960","Duration":"00:53:49","ChannelName":"Classical Music ?
