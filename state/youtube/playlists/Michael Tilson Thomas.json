When he next turned his sights to Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet, he wrote an enormous \u201CDramatic Symphony\u201D pairing orchestra with chorus and vocal soloists. This masterpiece\u2019s innovative design weaves choral sections that propel the plot with long instrumental sequences attempting to capture what words often fail to fully express. This performance draws music from the work\u2019s first two parts, including the love scene, the fairy queen of Mercutio\u2019s speech, and the spirited masked ball.\n\n#Berlioz #MichaelTilsonThomas #RomeoandJuliet #love \n\nOriginally performed 10/13/2019.\n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",

    "Description": "Enjoy this exceptional performance of Britten\u0027s masterwork from the opening concert of our 2018 season. MTT breathes new life into this seminal work with the help of the New World Symphony Fellows.\n\nBenjamin Britten had a precocious start in music, studying piano and viola and composing hundreds of works by the time he was a teenager. After graduating from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 1932, he began to make professional inroads in England, and a long visit the United States during World War II helped him clarify his musical and personal outlook. His traveling companion, the tenor Peter Pears, became his lifelong romantic partner and also a peerless interpreter; with Pears singing the title role of Peter Grimes in 1945, Britten\u2019s debut opera placed the 31-year-old composer at the forefront of British music.\n\nAfter the success of Peter Grimes, the British Ministry of Education commissioned Britten to write an orchestral work to be used in an educational video. It was fitting that he borrowed source material from Henry Purcell (1659-1695), the most significant composer of English theater music before Britten. Extracting a theme from the incidental music for the play Abdelazer, composed exactly 250 years earlier, Britten developed a set of variations to feature subsets of the orchestra, culminating in a final fugue. The resulting work, The Young Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra, has earned a rightful reputation as one of the most beloved gateways into classical music, in a rare class with Prokofiev\u2019s Peter and the Wolf and Saint-Sa\u00EBns\u2019 Carnival of the Animals.\n\n-- Copyright @ 2018 Aaron Grad\n\nOriginally performed October 20, 2018.\n\n#Britten #MichaelTIlsonThomas #Classicalmusic #Youngpersonsguidetotheorchestra\n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nVisit https://media.nws.edu to sign up for our FREE live streaming platform NWS Inside.\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",

    "Title": "Ives - Three Places in New England | Michael Tilson Thomas | New World Symphony (2021)",
    "Description": "MTT joins the Fellows in celebrating the one of the composers who established the American sound. Charles Ives conjures musical vignettes of American life, like sweetheart strolls, Fourth of July picnics and war.\n\nCharles Ives received his earliest musical training from his father, who had served in the Civil War as the Union\u2019s youngest bandmaster before returning to Danbury, Connecticut. The sounds of parade bands and church hymns conducted by his father seeped into young Ives\u2019 musical consciousness, as did their shared experiments with bitonality and other ear-stretching games. He became Connecticut\u2019s youngest salaried church organist at 14, and he went on to enroll at Yale, where his studies with Horatio Parker added a formal, European grounding to his craft and where he branched out beyond church music and popular songs to focus on composing serious art music.\n\nUpon graduating in 1898, Ives moved to New York, worked various insurance jobs and played in churches on the weekends. His unorthodox career began in earnest in 1902, when he withdrew from church work and any other public life in music. Externally, he worked to become one of the most successful dealers of life insurance in the industry. Privately, he composed the first truly American body of serious concert music, applying pioneering techniques often years or decades ahead of the musical establishment and drawing on the songs and hymns he loved. When he wrote his last new piece in 1926, hardly anyone knew his music even existed. Beginning in the 1930s, champions including Cowell, Copland and Bernstein rallied behind Ives, and his music finally reached the public after decades of obscurity. He earned the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 for his Symphony No. 3, composed 40 years earlier, and heard finally many of his works performed before he died in 1954.\n\nSome of the material that become part of Three Places in New England may have originated as early as 1903. Ives developed the work as a set of three movements, each based on a particular location, and he completed a version for full orchestra in 1914. The score languished for 15 years, by which point Ives had come to the attention of Henry Cowell, a younger American composer sympathetic to Ives\u2019 maverick tendencies. Cowell persuaded the conductor Nicolas Slonimsky, head of the Boston Chamber Orchestra, to program something by this unknown \u201Camateur\u201D composer from Connecticut. Upon Slonimsky\u2019s invitation, Ives undertook a revision of Three Places in New England in 1929, reducing the instrumentation to a chamber orchestra and condensing some of his musical ideas.

Und so, wie K\u00FCnstler*innen immer sagen: \u0022Hier stehe ich und kann nicht anders\u0022, hat Mahler auch reagiert. In der 6. Sinfonie ist im ersten Satz das monotone Marschieren auffallend. Es steht f\u00FCr das immer Gleiche und damit f\u00FCr das Alte. Es steht auch f\u00FCr S\u00E4tze wie: \u0022Es muss immer so weitergehen, weil es immer so war.\u0022 Mit diesem Rhythmus stellt Mahler so etwas wie ein altes Lebensthema voran, das im Verlauf der Sinfonie dann immer mehr aufbricht.

    "Description": "Witness magic as @michaeltilsonthomas explores Mahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony, a tortured swan song to love, society and life itself.\n\nMahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony is awash with suggestions of death, but it is hardly alone in that regard among his works. The Second Symphony took its nickname from an earlier song Mahler adapted for the last movement, Resurrection, and the three hammer strikes of the \u201CTragic\u201D Sixth Symphony represented a premonition, according to Alma Mahler, of the three tragedies of 1907, including their daughter\u2019s death. To treat the Ninth Symphony as some sort of deathbed confession would be an oversimplification, since Mahler was in relatively good health and spirits at the time he wrote it. Still, the diagnosis of his heart condition had brought his mortality uncomfortably close and the fateful numbering of a Symphony No. 9 had a resonance that could not be ignored.\n\nThe strongest sign of Mahler\u2019s leave-taking comes in the form of a quotation. In several places\u2014most prominently in the heart-wrenching tune of the Adagio finale\u2014Mahler incorporated the gesture of three notes descending stepwise. This motive matches the opening melody of Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonata No. 26, \u201CLes Adieux\u201D (\u201CThe Farewell\u201D), composed in honor of an absent patron. In the score, Beethoven wrote the German word for farewell, Lebewohl, over those three notes; in Mahler\u2019s symphony, each recurrence of the motive seems to recall that wistful word.\n\n-- Copyright \u00A9 2018 Aaron Grad\n\nOriginally performed May 5, 2018.\n\n#mahler #symphony #orchestra #mttmusic \n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nVisit https://media.nws.edu to sign up for our FREE live streaming platform NWS Inside.\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",

Its high energy could tempt the soloist, especially, to clang away, but Trifonov found ways to soften tone and weave in moments of delicate filigree among denser passages. In the opening movement, his touch was silvery, and sweet against the persistently brooding orchestral melody in the Largo. In the finale, he soared with fleet deftness as the orchestra kept pace with equal verve.\n\nTrifonov\u2019s encore calmed things down: his own piano arrangement of Rachmaninoff\u2019s Vocalise that felt like a jazz ballad. [...]\u0022\n\nhttps://seenandheard-international.com/2019/09/a-shiny-new-bauble-from-john-adams-opens-the-san-francisco-season/\n\n\nBy James Roy MacBean:  \n\n\u0022[...] Needless to say, Daniil Trifonov\u2019s awesome technical prowess was more than up to meeting and transcending the difficulties. Here, in this finale, we recognise what Martha Argerich noted when she first heard Trifonov play in Carnegie Hall: Trifonov combines formidable technique with an element of the demonic in his playing. Along with Martha Argerich we can only agree that \u201Cwe have never heard anything quite like that before.\u201D Daniil Trifonov, now aged 27, only gets better and better, if that\u2019s possible.

And some, maybe jazz influences, maybe a little bit of Gershwin or Ravel, but at the same it\u2019s still very Rachmaninoff\u2026 To me, it\u2019s music very much of a time. Like I feel also some even industrial elements in it, in, for example, how the orchestra very often uses certain rhythmical ostinato that brings to mind all of the industrialization that was happening at that time, and it\u2019s much more urban concerto, compared to his other works.\u201D \n\n\u0022The pianistic writing is already noticeably less full, it\u2019s more scarce, maybe, in the sense that only the most essential elements are in the piano part\u2026 But already here, orchestra has a lot of thematic roles, and many places where piano is in the background, or just a part of orchestral texture, for example in development section of finale\u2026 The piece also employs orchestra to a much more prominent extent than in his previous concerti, and we\u2019ll see a continuation of that in his next work, which would be the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.\u0022\n\n\nInterview with WRTI\u0027s Susan Lewis in October 2015 (11\u201949\u201D): \nhttps://www.wrti.org/wrti-spotlight/2016-07-05/the-philadelphians-in-concert-on-wrti-yannick-and-rachmaninoff-july-10-at-1-pm \n\n\nDaniil\u0027s performance with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Yannick N\u00E9zet-S\u00E9guin in October 2015: \nhttps://youtu.be/HEOzsV8Eym4?si=59mGlg8NEnylhO8Y \n\n\n#DaniilTrifonov \n#Rachmaninoff   \n#MichaelTilsonThomas\n#SanFranciscoSymphony \n#SFSymphony \n#RachmaninoffPianoConcerto \n#DaviesSymphonyHall \n#Rachmaninov",

    "Title": "Schubert - Symphony No.  9 | Michael Tilson Thomas | New World Symphony (2017)",
    "Description": "Great in scope and substance, Franz Schubert\u2019s final chapter to the symphonic genre is a true tour de force, as the genius songwriter infuses his expansive offering with fearless exuberance.\n\nThe disconnect between Franz Schubert\u2019s talent and his public recognition in his lifetime is hard to reconcile. This was a composer who produced hundreds of first-rate songs as a teenager, not to mention symphonies and chamber music, before even a note of his music had appeared in performance or in print. His songs gained a bit of traction in his lifetime, but his many attempts to break into opera were disastrous. As for his symphonies, not a single one reached the public before he died. As one publisher wrote to Schubert, in rejecting his manuscripts, \u2018The public does not yet sufficiently and generally understand the peculiar, often ingenious, but perhaps now and then somewhat curious procedures of your mind\u2019s creations.\u201D\n\nSchubert\u2019s first six symphonies, composed between the ages of 16 and 21, are beautiful and original but hardly controversial, with their strong resemblances to late Haydn and early Beethoven. Schubert took a more bold approach with the symphony he began in 1822, but he abandoned it after two movements, leaving what we now know as the \u201CUnfinished\u201D Symphony No. 8. Perhaps coincidentally and perhaps not, he set down that symphony around the same time that he suffered through the first phase of the syphilis infection that claimed his life six years later.\n\nA letter from 1824 attests to Schubert\u2019s continuing ambition to compose a \u201Cgrand symphony,\u201D a desire that could only have been stoked further when he attended the premiere that year of Beethoven\u2019s epic Symphony No. 9. The next year, while vacationing on an Austrian lake and enjoying his best health in years, Schubert began his massive symphony in C major, the one that would eventually earn the nickname \u201CThe Great.\u201D\n\n-- Copyright \u00A9 2017 Aaron Grad\n\nOriginally performed February 4, 2017.\n\n#schubert #symphony #michaeltilsonthomas #orchestra \n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nVisit https://media.nws.edu to sign up for our FREE live streaming platform NWS Inside.\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",

    "Title": "Stravinsky - Petrushka | Michael Tilson Thomas | New World Symphony (2020)",
    "Description": "Michael Tilson Thomas and the New World Symphony celebrates one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, his mentor Igor Stravinsky. Step right up for the carnivalesque Petrushka as it delves into a tale of puppets, ballerinas and more with Stravinsky\u2019s signature flair and jaunting rhythms.\n\nAfter the smash success of The Firebird in 1910, Stravinsky proposed creating another over-the-top score for the Ballets Russes, this one based on prehistoric pagan sacrifice, an idea that would soon become The Rite of Spring. But first, as he later recorded in his autobiography, \u201CI wanted to refresh myself by composing an orchestral piece in which the piano would play the most important part.\u201D The music he conceived brought to mind \u201Ca distinct picture of a puppet, suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggi.\u0022\n\nWhen Serge Diaghilev, the impresario behind the Ballets Russes, visited Stravinsky in Switzerland, he heard those first sketches and, as Stravinsky remembered it, \u201CHe was so much pleased with it that he would not leave it alone and began persuading me to develop the theme of the puppet\u2019s sufferings and make it into a whole ballet.\u201D Together they shaped a plot: \u201CThe fair, with its crowd, its booths, the little traditional theater, the character of the magician, with all his tricks; and the coming to life of the dolls\u2014Petrushka, his rival and the dancer\u2014and their love tragedy, which ends with Petrushka\u2019s death.\u201D\n\nPetrushka debuted in Paris on 1911, and its intoxicating synthesis of music, sets, costumes and choreography (with the legendary Vaslav Nijinsky dancing the title role) exemplified everything that made the Ballet Russes a modern sensation. The version of Petrushka heard here features a slightly reduced orchestration that Stravinsky prepared in 1947, which had the practical effect of renewing his copyrights and royalties after his immigration to the United States.\n\n-- \u00A9 2020 Aaron Grad\n\nOriginally performed January 25, 2020.\n\n#Petrushka #Stravinsky #MichaelTilsonThomas #classicalmusic \n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nVisit https://media.nws.edu to sign up for our FREE live streaming platform NWS Inside.\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",

    "Title": "Stravinsky - Symphony in Three Movements | Michael Tilson Thomas | New World Symphony (2020)",
    "Description": "The first major composition Stravinsky completed after immigrating to the United States was the Symphony in Three Movements. Settling in Hollywood, Stravinsky amassed a wealth of music originally intended for film, and this Symphony recycles ideas from several aborted projects. Somewhat uncharacteristically, Stravinsky claimed the work to be a direct response to current events, in particular his cinematic wartime experience.  The belligerent, piano-led first movement was first destined for a documentary about the Japanese army\u2019s scorched-earth tactics in China, while the concluding movement imagines newsreels of Nazi goose-stepping and the impending triumph of Allied forces.\n\nIn this memorable performance from 2018, MTT leads the orchestra in a stirring rendition of this pivotal work.\n\nOriginally performed January 25, 2018.\n\n#stravinsky #mttmusic #orchestra #worldwar2 \n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",

    "Title": "Stravinsky - The Firebird | Michael Tilson Thomas | New World Symphony (2018)",
    "Description": "Join MTT and the NWS Fellows for an evening of fantasy and magic. \n\nIgor Stravinsky, who always prioritized creative freedom over any controversy left in its wake, conjured an explosive score for The Firebird, one as enchanting as the folklore it paints. MTT leads a rare performance of the full ballet score, wickedly challenging and colorful from its triumphant hymns to the primal Infernal Dance. \n\nAs of 1902, Igor Stravinsky was a young law student whose musical pursuits amounted to some piano lessons and a year of private theory training. As he began to think more seriously of a life in music, he arranged to show some of his scores to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, the leading teacher and tastemaker in Saint Petersburg. Rimsky-Korsakov accepted Stravinsky as a private student, steering him away from the conservatory, where the untrained 20-year-old would have stuck out. Stravinsky flourished under Rimsky-Korsakov, who was as much a second father as a teacher. With two short orchestral works from 1908, Scherzo fantastique and Fireworks, Stravinsky established himself as a worthy heir to his mentor\u2019s legendary orchestral technique.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov died in 1908, but another helping hand soon filled the void: Serge Diaghilev, a Russian impresario based in Paris who had assembled a new ballet company, the Ballets Russes. On the strength of Scherzo fantastique and Fireworks, Diaghilev asked Stravinsky to supply a few orchestrations for Les Sylphides, a 1909 ballet based on Chopin\u2019s music. Stravinsky\u2019s breakthrough came later that year, when Diaghilev needed a composer for a major new ballet derived from a Russian folk-tale, The Firebird. The initial choice had been Anatoly Liadov; for reasons that are not entirely clear (probably Liadov\u2019s slow pace, or his notorious indolence), Diaghilev replaced Liadov with Stravinsky. By the time the commission was confirmed in December, a group of Diaghilev collaborators, led by choreographer Michel Fokine, had already scripted a scenario for Prince Ivan\u2019s adventures with the villainous Kastchei, his 13 princesses and the mythical Firebird. Stravinsky wrote most of the music in Saint Petersburg during the spring of 1910. He then traveled to Paris for the June 25 premiere, the first performance of his music outside of Russia.\n\nThe resounding success of The Firebird launched Stravinsky\u2019s international career and paved the way for his next Ballets Russes commissions, Petrushka and The Rite of Spring. But The Firebird was, just as significantly, a point of closure for Stravinsky. In no other music is his link to Rimsky-Korsakov so palpable, especially in the handling of folk themes and in the effervescent clarity of an outsized orchestra.\n\n-\u00A9 Aaron Grad 2018.\n\nOriginally performed February 17, 2018.\n\n#firebird #stravinsky #orchestra #ballet \n\nSubscribe for weekly instructional videos, performances and incredible orchestral content: https://www.youtube.com/@newworldsymphony\n\nVisit https://media.nws.edu to sign up for our FREE live streaming platform NWS Inside.\n\nFollow New World Symphony:\nInstagram: @nwsymphony\nTikTok: New-World-Symphony\nFacebook: NewWorldSymphony\nX: @nwsymphony\nWebsite: https://nws.edu\n\nPowered by Knight Foundation",
