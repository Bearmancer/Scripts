In reality Bowie filmed his part on a set in New York in 1980 , miming to an edited version of 'Station to Station' from the 'Stage' album. (At the time,  he was appearing on Broadway in 'The Elephant Man' and couldn't fly to Berlin for filming).  \n\nIn the movie, the performance footage then was edited with crowd scenes from an AC/DC stadium concert. The scene was intercut with plot elements consisting of teenagers smoking drugs and popping pills. One of the teenagers is then shown having a bad time of it sitting with his head in his hands with a contorted face. \n\nAll of this is fine in the context of the film. But I wanted to remove these distracting plot elements and make a video which would serve as a stand alone performance video as much as possible. To this end, I've re-edited the video to replace the drug taking scenes with more Bowie performance shots. (I've also removed a brief wide shot of AC/DC on stage which was in the original edit).\n\nThe soundtrack of the film version overdubs the song with a lot of newly added crowd noise. Again, fine for the film, but it sounds excessive when viewed as a stand alone video. So I've replaced it with the 2005 remastered version of the song from 'Stage'.\n\nIn the film the song fades off into the next scene. Here I've extended it and given it an actual ending.\n\nI hope you like it.","Duration":"00:06:11","ChannelName":"Mister Sussex","VideoId":"QymJI00mlSs","ChannelId":"UC2MKnyJQmF2cRTG_GzKrZBA"},{"Title":"David Bowie - The Making of 'Black Tie White Noise' Album","Description":"David Bowie discusses his inspiration and influences behind 'Black Tie White Noise' his 20th studio album released in 1993.

It marked the first time that he worked with Tony Visconti, the producer he’d be most closely associated with throughout his career. Recorded for Deram as a single in late 1967, the track was unreleased until Bowie selected it for his World Of David Bowie collection. Captured for Love You Till Tuesday, the film is full of Bowie’s signature moves. In fact, his parody of a rock and roller slinging his guitar around can be seen as a direct forerunner of Ziggy Stardust. \nWatch David Bowie's official music videos here: https://lnk.to/DavidBowieOfficialVideosAY \n \nSocials:\nhttps://www.davidbowie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidBowieReal\nhttps://www.instagram.com/davidbowie/","Duration":"00:03:27","ChannelName":"DavidBowieVEVO","VideoId":"U_hX482pLbE","ChannelId":"UCh8hlIe7EcmVilHjnrE7gNw"},{"Title":"David Bowie - Let's Dance (Official Video)","Description":"The official music video for David Bowie - Let's Dance. \n\nTaken from Bowie's 'Let's Dance' album released in 1983, which featured the singles 'Let's Dance', 'China Girl', 'Modern Love' and 'Without You'.\n\nSubscribe to the David Bowie channel for all the best official music videos, live performances and interviews here - \nSubscribe now: http://bit.ly/2lO9yQo\n\nListen to more from the Album Let's Dance here: https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kI3Tm2L8DXgnJ2qmvEoDOgONoMSlPzYTs\n\nWatch David Bowie's official music videos here: https://lnk.to/DavidBowieOfficialVideos\n\nFollow David Bowie:\nhttps://www.davidbowie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidBowieReal\nhttps://www.instagram.com/davidbowie/\n\nLyrics\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\nPut on your red shoes and dance the blues\n(Let's dance)\nTo the song they're playing on the radio\n(Let's sway)\nWhile colour lights up your face\n(Let's sway)\nSway through the crowd to an empty space\n\nIf you say run, I'll run with you\nAnd if you say hide, we'll hide\nBecause my love for you\nWould break my heart in two\nIf you should fall, into my arms\nAnd tremble like a flower\n\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\nFor fear your grace should fall\n(Let's dance)\nFor fear tonight is all\n(Let's sway)\nYou could look into my eyes\n(Let's sway)\nUnder the moonlight, this serious moonlight\n\nAnd if you say run, I'll run with you\nAnd if you say hide, we'll hide\nBecause my love for you\nWould break my heart in two\nIf you should fall, into my arms\nAnd tremble like a flower\n\n\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\nPut on your red shoes and dance the blues\n(Let's dance)\nTo the song we're playing\n(Let's sway)\n(Let's sway)\nUnder the moonlight, this serious moonlight\n\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's)\n(Let's)\n(Let's)\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's)\n\nLet's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's sway)\n(Let's sway)\nLet's dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\n(Let's dance)\n\nAbout David Bowie:\nDavid Bowie redefined musical genres and the potential of live performance for generations of music lovers.

The song is sung from a child's perspective, with all the requisite desperation to grow up and echoes 'There Is A Happy Land' from his debut album.\n\nWith references to his parents and 'Grandfather Jones', as well as a dog called 'Bonzo', When I'm Five has all the hallmarks of 60s Bowie, quirky, childlike and never less than interesting and he ensures all of his then-recent training as a mime is to the fore in the film.\n\nDigitally restored to 1080p HD.\n\nSocials:\nhttps://www.davidbowie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidBowieReal\nhttps://www.instagram.com/davidbowie/","Duration":"00:03:11","ChannelName":"DavidBowieVEVO","VideoId":"qLoO9Ek-3FU","ChannelId":"UCh8hlIe7EcmVilHjnrE7gNw"},{"Title":"David Bowie - Where Are We Now?
