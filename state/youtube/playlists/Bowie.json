    "Title": "David Bowie - Station To Station (Christiane F ) 1980 - new edit, remastered HD",
    "Description": "You may already be familiar with this clip from the 1981 film \u0027Christiane F\u0027, but this version is a new extended edit (more Bowie, less drugged up teenagers) and has a new improved soundtrack in an attempt to make a more self contained, stand alone version.\n\nIn the film, this scene shows the main character of the film, Christiane, attending a 70\u0027s Bowie concert in Berlin with her friends.  In reality Bowie filmed his part on a set in New York in 1980 , miming to an edited version of \u0027Station to Station\u0027 from the \u0027Stage\u0027 album. (At the time,  he was appearing on Broadway in \u0027The Elephant Man\u0027 and couldn\u0027t fly to Berlin for filming).  \n\nIn the movie, the performance footage then was edited with crowd scenes from an AC/DC stadium concert. The scene was intercut with plot elements consisting of teenagers smoking drugs and popping pills. One of the teenagers is then shown having a bad time of it sitting with his head in his hands with a contorted face. \n\nAll of this is fine in the context of the film. But I wanted to remove these distracting plot elements and make a video which would serve as a stand alone performance video as much as possible. To this end, I\u0027ve re-edited the video to replace the drug taking scenes with more Bowie performance shots. (I\u0027ve also removed a brief wide shot of AC/DC on stage which was in the original edit).\n\nThe soundtrack of the film version overdubs the song with a lot of newly added crowd noise. Again, fine for the film, but it sounds excessive when viewed as a stand alone video. So I\u0027ve replaced it with the 2005 remastered version of the song from \u0027Stage\u0027.\n\nIn the film the song fades off into the next scene. Here I\u0027ve extended it and given it an actual ending.\n\nI hope you like it.",

It marked the first time that he worked with Tony Visconti, the producer he\u2019d be most closely associated with throughout his career. Recorded for Deram as a single in late 1967, the track was unreleased until Bowie selected it for his World Of David Bowie collection. Captured for Love You Till Tuesday, the film is full of Bowie\u2019s signature moves. In fact, his parody of a rock and roller slinging his guitar around can be seen as a direct forerunner of Ziggy Stardust. \nWatch David Bowie\u0027s official music videos here: https://lnk.to/DavidBowieOfficialVideosAY \n \nSocials:\nhttps://www.davidbowie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidBowieReal\nhttps://www.instagram.com/davidbowie/",

Recorded after the body of his debut album was made, he and manager Ken Pitt believed that this would be the song that would turn him into a star. Re-recorded with a string arrangement in the summer of 67 for a potential single , When I Live My Dream featured in Bowie\u2019s 1967 Lindsay Kemp-directed mime showcase Pierrot in Turquoise and again, as the closing number in Love You Til Tuesday.

The song is sung from a child\u0027s perspective, with all the requisite desperation to grow up and echoes \u0027There Is A Happy Land\u0027 from his debut album.\n\nWith references to his parents and \u0027Grandfather Jones\u0027, as well as a dog called \u0027Bonzo\u0027, When I\u0027m Five has all the hallmarks of 60s Bowie, quirky, childlike and never less than interesting and he ensures all of his then-recent training as a mime is to the fore in the film.\n\nDigitally restored to 1080p HD.\n\nSocials:\nhttps://www.davidbowie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/davidbowie/\nhttps://twitter.com/DavidBowieReal\nhttps://www.instagram.com/davidbowie/",
