A Koto Concerto was Eto’s idea, and he quickly prevailed upon Cowell to write it. Cowell, an eclectic composer, was championed by Stokowski, Ormandy, and Koussevitsky. Since his death in 1965, his music (and his life story, which included a term of imprisonment for gay sex) have largely been forgotten. Cowell was present at this premiere, which would travel down to Washington, DC and then Carnegie Hall in the days following this concert, a frequent route for the orchestra.  The Wagner was commercially recorded multiple times by Philadelphia beginning in the early 1930s, under Stokowski and Ormandy for Victor, Columbia, and RCA, and under Thielemann for DG (in 1997).","Duration":"00:53:25","ChannelName":"Peter Kohn","VideoId":"aI78V1F2WBY","ChannelId":"UCPjypaqxlfR5LrCJq3j1Pnw"},{"Title":"Darius Milhaud: Symphonie n° 1 op.210 (1939) / Stokowski","Description":"Darius Milhaud (1892-1974): Sinfonia n.1 op.210 (1939) --- NBC Symphony Orchestra diretta da Leopold Stokowski (live 1942) ---\n\nI.

Interesting to note that none of the principals is a Stokowski holdover; each was hired by Ormandy, yet Stokowski’s program’s stated purpose is to exhibit their virtuosity. Certainly sheds some doubt on the mythology of friction between Stokie and EO. Make sure to hear another Gabrieli canzon from 1972 under Ozawa’s baton, separately posted on this channel. And for an awe-inspiring celebration of both Gabrieli and the state of leading American orchestras, find the Columbia/Sony album “The Antiphonal Music of Gabrieli,” recorded in 1968 in Philadelphia with Chicago and Cleveland’s brass combining with Philadelphia’s. Although Bill Smith doesn’t mention it, the Vivaldi is almost certainly Stokowski’s own arrangement previously commercially recorded in 1934 on Victor. It is nice to hear the Mozart in more natural stereo sound than the tinny 1957 commercial recording on Columbia with these same forces, even with Mason Jones breaking some notes in the first movement.

German-born Kurt Leimer (1920-1974) was a concert pianist who also combined composing with teaching. He persuaded several great conductors to accompany him in his own works, including Herbert von Karajan for a recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra of his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. Stokowski also conducted the Symphony of the Air for another Leimer recording, his Piano Concerto No. 4.\n \nHere we see the Maestro and the composer together in a 1968 Swiss-Italian TV studio performance of Leimer's 2nd Piano Concerto. A CD release of the soundtrack was met with comments on its references to Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Gershwin and others, so some listeners might find the work a bit of a mish-mash. It seems hardly likely that it will ever be taken into the general piano concerto repertoire, so it is uploaded here for its rarity value.

For some years I have had a bootleg-ish CD with two performances of Jorge Bolet that were recorded by persons in the audience at his concerts.  (I have read that Bolet actually encouraged patrons to make recordings for themselves.)  The quality of these recordings was very poor, and in fact the second recording (a Brahms piece) is unlistenable as the batteries were running low on the tape player causing massive wow and flutter.\n\nAll I know about this recording is that it was stated on the CD hat it was Jorge Bolet with Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra.  The recording is ostensibly from 1971.   There is little doubt this is Jorge Bolet.   It is a live recording and you will hear audience noise and at one point a siren outside outside the venue can be heard!\n\nI have done my best to try to make the performance more listenable.   This included some compromises, such as trying to give greater emphasis to the piano so that it could be heard over the orchestra.  In any case, it is chance to hear Bolet play this live - and adds to the two other studio recordings he made of this piece (both posted on my channel.)\n\nFinally - please note that like the other Bolet performances he cuts the cadenza short by 10 measures.

Hitherto they had been mainly conducted by such British musicians as Sir Henry Wood and his successor Sir Malcolm Sargent but from 1963 onwards more and more non-British conductors have taken part.\n\nFor his Proms debut at the Royal Albert Hall, with the BBCSO on 23 July 1963, Stokowski was asked to conclude the concert with his own orchestration of Mussorgsky's 'Pictures at an Exhibition' in its UK Premiere. The programme also included Britten's 'Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Purcell' and Beethoven's 7th Symphony, both of which have been released on CD. \n\nStokowski's version of 'Pictures at an Exhibition' omits the two French locations ('Limoges' and 'Tuileries') as he felt the work as whole should be as 'Slavic' as possible.

Violinist Joachim took the young Willeke to meet Brahms, and the three of them played the composer's chamber music. Willeke studied the Brahms 'cello works with the composer, played with numerous other major composers of the latter 19th Century, including Grieg and Richard Strauss and was the dedicatee of their Sonatas for Violoncello and Piano.

It began with the 'Academic Festival' Overture to which Sir Malcolm Sargent had added his own choral finale and which was adopted by the conductor. The concert was not broadcast but was surreptitiously taped 'in the hall', so the sound quality is not of the best. However, the performance is unique as far as Stokowski's repertoire is concerned, so is duly presented here.","Duration":"00:10:57","ChannelName":"adam28xx","VideoId":"Vt7-D0H09mc","ChannelId":"UCJbfiRvOlcTfHrbi98L9IZA"},{"Title":"Stokowski conducts Schubert \"Unfinished\" Symphony - All-American Youth Orchestra (1941)","Description":"Leopold Stokowski conducted a great many recording premieres during his 60 years as an illustrious 20th Century maestro and Schubert's \"Unfinished\" Symphony was one of them. In 1924 he and the Philadelphia Orchestra made the first American recording of the work on acoustic 78s in front of an enormous wooden horn. Four years later, with the introduction of microphones, they re-recorded it in the new electrical method.\n\nAfter a quarter of a century in Philadelphia, Stokowski decided it was time to move on and in 1940 he created the All-American Youth Orchestra. He made a number of 78s with them for Coliumbia, including a remake of the Schubert \"Unfinished.\" He was to record it for the last time in 1969, at the age of 87, with the London Philharmonic in \"Phase 4 Stereo.\" However, his 1941 recording with its youthful band of American players receives a particularly dramatic performance, as will be heard in this upload.\n\nSchubert started the work in 1822 but left it incomplete, causing much speculation as to his reasons. These have never been resolved but the two-movement work has nevertheless become one of the most popular symphonies in the classical orchestral repertoire.\n\n(I) Allegro moderato\n(II) Andante con moto\n\nFrom 'Cala Records' CACD0520.","Duration":"00:23:28","ChannelName":"adam28xx","VideoId":"thxCRMSqUAU","ChannelId":"UCJbfiRvOlcTfHrbi98L9IZA"},{"Title":"Stokowski conducts Tchaikovsky 'Italian Caprice' - London Philharmonic (1973 'live')","Description":"Leopold Stokowski conducted numerous \"premieres\" in the days of 78s and in 1929 he made the first American recording of Tchaikovsky's \"Capriccio Italien\" with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Forty-four years later, at the age of 91, he gave his last public performance of the work with the London Philharmonic in the Royal Albert Hall. As will be heard, even at that great age, the now very frail conductor had lost none of his vitality.

One of the items was Tchaikovsky's \"Romeo and Juliet\" Overture. This had run to three different editions, the second and third of which were published, due to the composer's many revisions. In 'The Life and Letters of Tchaikovsky' by his brother Modest, it was revealed that Balakirev objected to the loud accentuated chords at the end of the work on the grounds that they \"contradicted the meaning of the play\" and were \"inartistic.\" According to Modest, Tchaikovsky then supplied a quiet ending at Balakirev's suggestion, though it was never published. Stokowski clearly knew of Balakirev's comments and agreed with them, since he supplied an ending of his own which omitted those loud \"inartistic\" chords. It is that version we hear in this Swiss-Italian Radio Orchestra performance.","Duration":"00:20:40","ChannelName":"adam28xx","VideoId":"-GteUS553vI","ChannelId":"UCJbfiRvOlcTfHrbi98L9IZA"},{"Title":"Tchaikovsky 'Eugene Onegin' Polonaise - Stokowski conducts","Description":"Leopold Stokowski returned to England at the age of 90 in 1972 and remained busily active in the recording studio and concert hall.
