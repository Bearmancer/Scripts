    "Description": "Jacob Kimmel thinks he can find the transcription factors to reverse aging. We do a deep dive on why this might be plausible and why evolution hasn’t already optimized for longevity. We also talk about why drug discovery has been getting exponentially harder, and what a new platform for biological understanding to speed up progress would look like. As a bonus, we get into the nitty gritty of gene delivery and Jacob’s controversial takes on CAR-T cells. For full disclosure, I am an angel investor in NewLimit.

It stops us from feeling pride in our talents or celebrating our victories, because it whispers \"You're still not good enough.\"\n\nAnd shame can be especially vicious for those of us who are autistic, or who have another form of neurodivergence like ADHD. We see neurotypical folks breezing through a challenge that we struggle with, and shame whispers \"You should be more like them.\"\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you that shame is wrong. There's nothing wrong with you, and it's okay that some things are harder for you than they are for someone else. That's just a part of what it means to be neurodivergent; we get peaks and valleys. \n\nThat's why I made this video - so you know what to do when shame comes knocking.\n\n#autism #shame #selfconfidence #selflove #neurodiversity #neurodivergent #autism #autismacceptance \n\n00:00 - My embarrassing story\n02:29 - Strengths and weaknesses in autism\n03:27 - Why autistic struggles cause shame\n04:12 - How shame keeps you stuck\n06:00 - Regaining your confidence\n07:45 - Leaving shame behind\n08:38 - The truth about failure\n\nThis video was created by autistic clinical psychologist Dr. Daniel Wendler (that's me!)
