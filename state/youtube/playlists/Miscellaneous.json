We do a deep dive on why this might be plausible and why evolution hasn\u2019t already optimized for longevity. We also talk about why drug discovery has been getting exponentially harder, and what a new platform for biological understanding to speed up progress would look like. As a bonus, we get into the nitty gritty of gene delivery and Jacob\u2019s controversial takes on CAR-T cells. For full disclosure, I am an angel investor in NewLimit.

There\u0027s nothing wrong with you, and it\u0027s okay that some things are harder for you than they are for someone else.
