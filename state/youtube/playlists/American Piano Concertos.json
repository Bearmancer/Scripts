    "Title": "Leo Ornstein - Piano Concerto (5 THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS TRIBUTE)",
    "Description": "A pyrotechnical dazzler, Ornstein’s Concerto was clearly written by a pianist with a physical passion for hammering every inch of the keyboard. From the first note, the writing for piano teems with raw virtuosity. Using a traditional three-movement concerto form, the work glories in chromatic runs and gapped scales, as well as chords built of fourths and fifths (no tame triads for Ornstein). Rapid-fire runs and octave gymnastics alternate within toccata-like sections and passages of static repetition. Defying the reputation of modernists for taking their art too seriously, this work brims with fun and wild daring. Like watching a high-diver, it leaves the listener breathless, wondering if a safe landing is possible.\n\nFifty years after its composition, in a letter to Oliver Daniel, who was then preparing a biography of Stokowski, Ornstein recalled rehearsals for the premiere of the Concerto and gave a sense of the challenge of performing a brand-new work:\n\n\"I remember our meeting when Stokowski looked at the score. He had a funny little room at the head of a rickety stairway back of the stage of the old Academy of Music. He studied the score for a long time, then turned to me and said, ‘Let’s do it.’ We eventually gave two performances in Philadelphia and one in New York. He must have realized the difficulty of the piece because instead of leaving the rehearsal for Friday morning, the day of the concert, he set the first rehearsal for the previous Monday. Then his professionalism was very evident. He turned to the men and indicated that there would have to be not only extra rehearsals but longer ones. He practically devoted the entire week’s work to the Concerto and gave a dazzling performance. It was entirely clear to me after working with him that under the surface appearance of great bravura there was a thoroughness that might almost be considered of an academic nature.\"\n\n(americansymphony.org)\n\nPlease take note that the audio AND the sheet music ARE NOT mine.

    "Title": "Piano Concerto - Peter Mennin",
    "Description": "Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Igor Buketoff. John Ogdon as the piano soloist.\n\nI - Maestoso - Allegro: 0:00\nII - Adagio religioso: 11:14\nIII - Allegro vivace: 19:42\n\nMennin's Piano Concerto was composed in 1957, same year as he went to a cultural exchange to the Soviet Union. It was commissioned by George Szell for the Cleveland Orchestra’s 40th Anniversary. It was premiered by said orchestra and conductor in February 1958, with Eunice Podis as the piano soloist. The concerto, divided in three movements, requires a soloist with extraordinary stamina, along with virtuosity of an unusual kind. Rather than following the conventional Romantic concept of a concerto, Mennin’s is more a Baroque concerto gone wild.\n\nThe first movement opens with an ominous introduction, with a motive that is the basis of the movement, introduced by the brass and fully exposed by the piano. The allegro begins with an energetic and hectic main theme, derived from said motive. The soloist performs in fast toccata-like passages of great intensity, as the primary voice within the largely contrapuntal texture. The solo part is intricately interwoven motivically, but at times alternates with the orchestra in a manner suggestive of a Baroque ritornello. More calm and melodic sections attempt to be formed, but they are swept by the lively dynamism of the soloist. The music rises in a great orchestral climax, followed by a new virtuosic showcase for the pianist that culminates in an extremely fast and powerful cadenza, in which the main motive reappears. A firm coda ends the movement.\n\nThe second movement begins with the strings with a slow, chromatic opening of great soberness. The soloist presents a melodic contained theme of almost religious nature. Follows a development of these materials through a dense counterpoint. The music is largely reflective in character, and displays an icy, unearthly beauty. A dissonant climax follows with an orchestral tutti. Another pensive section leads to another climax, with an intense declamation from the soloist. A deeply contemplative coda ends the movement.\n\nThe third movement opens with a rhythmic theme derived from the opening motive, followed by interventions from the pianist. As in the first movement, the piano figurations are designed to produce hard, brittle sonorities. Follows a development on the main theme, energetic and lively in character. The piece builds without let-up until it reaches a climax of unequivocal finality. A decided coda ends the whole work.\n\nPicture: \"Saint Anatoles\" by the American concept artist Will Burns.\n\nMusical analysis partially written by myself: Source: https://bit.ly/3KAo46K\n\nUnfortunately the score is not available.",
