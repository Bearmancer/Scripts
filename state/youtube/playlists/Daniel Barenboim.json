For all its symbolism, and hopefully something rather more than that, the aims and ambitions of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra are first and foremost musical ones: the Middle East’s political divides are eschewed for a union of musical talent, which speaks volumes for cultural interaction. Once the music starts, that is what matters. And it mattered considerably at this concert, the orchestra’s members fresh from a residency in Seville – radiating learning and conviction, and sharing the wonderful power of music in no uncertain terms. In this live recording from a concert in the Victoria Hall in Geneva two familiar masterworks were presented with significant import, Beethoven’s 3rd piano concerto and Tchaikovsky's famous 5th Symphony. As an encore, we also hear the overture from Verdi's La Forza del destino and Jean Sibelius' \"Valse triste\".\n\nDirected by Bob Cole\n\nA production of EuroArts Music International\nIn Coproduction with Fundación tres Culturas del Mediterráneo\n\n© 2004 EuroArts Music International","Duration":"00:37:59","ChannelName":"EuroArtsChannel","VideoId":"D_iPsP8LXI0","ChannelId":"UCt7SG8q4GUDMLfbkViwkWLQ"},{"Title":"Beethoven - Symphony No. 9 (Daniel Barenboim & the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra)","Description":"From the Philharmonie Berlin, Summer 2006,\nDaniel Barenboim and West-Eastern Divan perform Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.\n\nSubscribe to EuroArts: https://goo.gl/jrui3M\nWatch this performance and more in our \"Great German Composers\" compilation: https://youtu.be/jR68yyZ3jh0\n\nLudwig van Beethoven - Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, \"Chorale\"\n0:00 Entrance\n1:00 I.

The original version of 1804/05, with the programmatic title Leonore, oder Der Triumph der ehelichen Liebe (Leonore, or the Triumph of Married Love), was rewritten twice by Beethoven before the composer himself premiered it under the name Fidelio in 1814. There are four different overtures to the three versions of the opera, whereby it was the Overture No. 3, Op. 72b, which then began its own career, so to speak. It’s to this day a popular overture for concerts, usually at the beginning of the program.\n\nIn itself, Leonore Overture No. 3 is an instrumental, abridged version of the opera Fidelio, the plot and moods of which it anticipates in concise form. Fidelio is a ‘rescue opera’, in which the heroine Leonore slips into the role of the titular jailer, in order to free her beloved husband Florestan from prison. The situation seems hopeless, however, as Florestan's execution is imminent. At the last moment, a trumpet melody announces the redeeming and righteous minister, who will bring about Florestan's liberation. This trumpet melody not only forms the suspenseful climax of the opera Fidelio but is also the point at which the threads of the Leonore Overture converge (08:54) before the orchestra celebrates the triumph of freedom in a heroically serene round of melodies.\n\nThe West-Eastern Divan Orchestra is a very special ensemble: It’s comprised of young Israeli and Arab musicians, and campaigns for a peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict. The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra – founded in 1999 – holds concerts all over the world. Proceeds from this Berlin concert went to the Barenboim-Said Academy, which supports musical education programs.\n\n© EuroArts\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nwww.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#Barenboim #WestEasternDivanOrchestra #LeonoreOverture","Duration":"00:16:39","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"pd9oOLAyevA","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Beethoven: Piano Concerto No. 3 | Daniel Barenboim, Zubin Mehta & the Staatskapelle Berlin","Description":"The legendary concert for Daniel Barenboim's 70th birthday features one of the greatest classics for pianists: Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, performed by the Staatskapelle Berlin under the direction of Zubin Mehta, with Daniel Barenboim on piano, of course. The concert took place at the Philharmonie Berlin in 2012. It was started off with “Happy Birthday to You.” \n \n(00:00) Entrance \n(00:35) Happy Birthday to You \n(01:30) Allegro con brio \n(20:17) Largo \n(29:50) Rondo: Allegro \n \nThe Piano Concerto No. 3 is said to have electrified the audience at its premiere on April 5, 1803. Ludwig van Beethoven (1770 - 1827), a well-known piano virtuoso at the time, sat at the piano himself. He had asked his friend Ignaz Xaver von Seyfried to turn the sheet music during the performance. Unlike the orchestral parts, however, he had not yet written down the solo. Apart from a few marks that were illegible to his friend and some notations on how the piece was to progress, the sheets are said to have been completely blank. Whether Beethoven was in a hurry — as was often the case — and thus improvised the performance, or whether he played from memory and was having a laugh with his friend, is not known for certain. \n \nOf Beethoven's five piano concertos, only the third is in a minor key. To be more precise, it is in C minor, inspired by Mozart's C minor Concerto K. 491. And yet Beethoven liked to experiment with classical forms and musical motifs. This is why this third piano concerto is also described as a symphonic solo concerto. This concerto form developed during the 19th century and is characterized by the close interweaving of the motivic and thematic development of the orchestral parts and the solo piano. \n \nIn the final movement, the Rondo Allegro, Beethoven switches from the rather somber and sad key of C minor to E-flat major, bringing the concerto to a joyful and virtuosic conclusion. \n \n© 2012 Accentus/Unitel \n \nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n  \nin our Beethoven playlist: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w \n  \nand in our playlist with piano concertos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU7k2TJgrgNCc9aygnNkaGZ \n  \nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic \n  \n#Beethoven #pianoconcert #DanielBarenboim","Duration":"00:40:22","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"UXGy1bpEAUw","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Beethoven: Symphony No. 3 / Daniel Barenboim (Teatro Colón, 2010)","Description":"Concierto de Daniel Barenboim y la Orquesta Diván Este - Oeste en el Teatro Colón de Buenos Aires.

Maestoso\n(24:10) II. Adagio \n(38:32) III. Rondo. Allegro non troppo\n\nIt took Johannes Brahms (1833-1897) a full five years to write his first piano concerto. He began composing it in the spring of 1854, shortly after the attempted suicide of his friend and mentor Robert Schumann. Finally, on 22 January 1859, the Piano Concerto No. 1 in in D Minor, Op. 15, had its premiere at the Royal Court Theatre in Hanover under the direction of Joseph Joachim. Performing at the piano was the composer himself.\n\nIt had been a long and arduous journey: Brahms had originally planned a sonata for two pianos, but came to the conclusion that two pianos were not enough to give full expression to the music. The attempt to rework the draft into a symphony stalled in its early stages because the young Brahms was not yet up to the supreme task of composing instrumental music in the tradition of Beethoven.\n\nIn February 1855, he had the idea of reworking the draft of the first movement of the piano sonata into a piano concerto, as he wrote in a letter to Clara Schumann: \"Can you imagine the dream I had last night. I had turned my failed symphony into my piano concerto and was playing it. From the first movement and scherzo to the finale, it was terribly difficult and powerful. I was absolutely thrilled.\" After several revisions, the final result was an impressive work with three long movements.\n\nFun fact: Incidentally, it would be many years before Brahms presented his First Symphony in 1876, the result of a no less lengthy compositional process.\n\n© 2014 Unitel\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nFind the best of Brahms here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU5_GAu2NLbH0fBf6CEX8kQ\n\nand check out more piano concertos here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mh4mEKEdRw&list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU5_GAu2NLbH0fBf6CEX8kQ\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#pianoconcerto #brahms #classicalpiano","Duration":"00:52:53","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"mNcQGsF2uIw","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2 | Daniel Barenboim, Gustavo Dudamel & the Staatskapelle Berlin","Description":"A piano concerto which is like a great symphony - and with a star cast to boot! Brahms' romantic Piano Concerto No. 2 is played by Daniel Barenboim (piano) and the Staatskapelle Berlin under the baton of Gustavo Dudamel. The concert took place at the Musikfest Berlin in September 2014 in the Berlin Philharmonie.\n\n(00:00) Coming on Stage\n(00:30) I. Allegro non troppo\n(19:15) II. Allegro appassionato\n(29:12) III. Andante\n(41:52) IV. Allegretto grazioso\n\nTo a friend, Johannes Brahms (1833 - 1897) wrote that he had composed a “very small piano concerto”, but he was referring to his opulent Piano Concerto No. 2 in B flat major op. 83, which delighted audiences in 1881. At the premiere, the composer himself demonstrated his virtuoso skills on the piano. The reception of Brahms' first piano concerto 22 years earlier had been rather muted. Perhaps because Brahms compositional style was not yet so well established. For comparison you can find the Piano Concerto No. 1 by Johannes Brahms right here: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNcQGsF2uIw&t=237s\n\nWhen Brahms wrote his second piano concerto, he was already a well-to-do 44-year-old and a successful composer of chamber music and song (Lieder). He earned a good living as a freelance composer. His fame and reputation made audiences very eager to hear his new work.\n\nSome critics considered it more of a symphony with solo piano, a fusion of classical symphonic form and virtuoso concerto. Johannes Brahms did not leave the development of the musical themes to the orchestra alone. The piano concerto begins with the horns playing the first Romantic motif, which is then taken up by the piano in order to develop it with the orchestra. The piano acts essentially as an orchestral instrument and is almost constantly present.\n\nThe German composer had not only written to his friend Elisabeth von Herzogenberg that he had written a very small piano concerto, but also that the concerto had “a very small, delicate scherzo”. This can be heard in the second movement, which is sandwiched into a total of four movements. This in itself was unusual, as instrumental concertos at the time were usually in three movements. Moreover, it is by no means a “delicate little scherzo”, but a powerful piano part that demands the highest level of technique and virtuosity.\n\nBrahms is still known today for his Lieder compositions and for the folk elements in his works. The 3rd movement begins with delicate solo cello sounds playing a catchy melancholy melody. The Romantic composer took up this melody again in 1886 and used it in the song “Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer” (No. 2 in Fünf Lieder, Op. 105). In the final movement, a rondo, elements from Hungarian folklore appear, as in Brahms' Hungarian Dances.\n\nBarenboim and Dudamel had already performed together at La Scala in Milan in 2012 at a concert celebrating Daniel Barenboim's 70th birthday. This successful collaboration was resumed two years later in Berlin. The program was particularly demanding for the pianist: Both Piano Concertos by Johannes Brahms were on the agenda. The concert garnered rave reviews praising Barenboim as a phenomenon due to his boundless energy, concentration and sheer joy of playing.\n\n© 2014 Unitel\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nFind the best of Brahms here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU5_GAu2NLbH0fBf6CEX8kQ\n\nFind more piano concertos here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mh4mEKEdRw&list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU5_GAu2NLbH0fBf6CEX8kQ\n\nAnd check out our playlist with romantic music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiOGCwZGgXY&list=PL_SdnzPd3eBUCHNKKxIIM88sntDk1TVih\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#johannesbrahms #pianoconcerto #dudamel","Duration":"00:52:49","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"VghJWGQ2IU0","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Bronfman/Barenboim - Brahms - Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15","Description":"Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor, Op. 15\nI.

For all its symbolism, and hopefully something rather more than that, the aims and ambitions of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra are first and foremost musical ones: the Middle East’s political divides are eschewed for a union of musical talent, which speaks volumes for cultural interaction. Once the music starts, that is what matters. And it mattered considerably at this concert, the orchestra’s members fresh from a residency in Seville – radiating learning and conviction, and sharing the wonderful power of music in no uncertain terms. In this live recording from a concert in the Victoria Hall in Geneva two familiar masterworks were presented with significant import, Beethoven’s 3rd piano concerto and Tchaikovsky's famous 5th Symphony. As an encore, we also hear the overture from Verdi's \"La Forza del destino\" and Jean Sibelius' \"Valse triste\".\n\nDirected by Bob Cole\n\nA production of EuroArts Music International\nIn Coproduction with Fundación tres Culturas del Mediterráneo\n\n© 2004 EuroArts Music International","Duration":"01:43:30","ChannelName":"EuroArtsChannel","VideoId":"HZ761vKbpP8","ChannelId":"UCt7SG8q4GUDMLfbkViwkWLQ"},{"Title":"Daniel Barenboim & West-Eastern Divan: Richard Wagner Concert | Live at Ravello (w/ Waltraud Meier)","Description":"Live from the Ravello Festival Italy, 2008:\nDaniel Barenboim & the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra perform a concert of three pieces by Richard Wagner: Prelude from \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\", Prelude & \"Liebestod\" from \"Tristan und Isolde\" and finally \"The Valkyrie\", Act I. \nFeaturing the soloists Waltraud Meier, Simon O'Neill, and John Tomlinson.\n\n00:00:00 Intro\n00:01:53 Richard Wagner - Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg): Prelude (West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, Daniel Barenboim)\n00:12:05 Richard Wagner - Tristan and Isolde WWV 90: Prelude and \"Liebestod\" (Waltraud Meier, West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, Daniel Barenboim)\n00:30:28 Richard Wagner - Walküre (The Valkyrie): Act I (Waltraud Meier, Simon O'Neill, John Tomlinson, West-Eastern Divan Orchestra & Daniel Barenboim)\n\nWaltraud Meier - soprano\nSimon O'Neill - tenor\nJohn Tomlinson - bass\n\nWest-Eastern Divan Orchestra\nDaniel Barenboim - conductor\n\nSubscribe to EuroArts: https://goo.gl/jrui3M\nWatch the full opera \"Die Meistersänger von Nürnberg\": https://youtu.be/w6n2TUIPctA\nWatch the full opera \"Tristan und Isolde\": https://youtu.be/QwBO3uR6LQQ\nWatch another performance of Waltraud Meier & West-Eastern Divan Orchestra performing \"Liebestod\": https://youtu.be/x51T9Te2uEM\n\nWhen Daniel Barenboim and the late Palestinian author Edward Said in 1998 conceived the idea of promoting understanding in the Middle East by gathering young musicians from Israel and Arab countries in an orchestra, it was regarded as just another idealistic dream. When the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra (named after Goethe’s eponymous collection of poems) traveled to Ramallah in 2005, it was turned into a sensational film by EuroArts and Barenboim’s work with these young people already created interest all over the world. Meanwhile, the young ensemble has become almost a household name. This year the concert was originally planned to take place within the current international concert tour at the historic site of the 6,000-seat Roman Theatre in Amman, Jordan. For security reasons, a new location had to be found at short notice and the concert was relocated to the picturesque Amalfi coast and the Ravello Festival. \nConducted by Daniel Barenboim, the concert was dedicated to Richard Wagner. The West-Eastern Divan is not only a musical project, it is also a forum for cross-cultural dialogue among the young musicians and with the audience. In this broadcast, EuroArts will transport the atmosphere of an orchestra whose aim is to put music at the forefront of their vision of democratic and civilized life.\n\nDirected by Michael Beyer\n\nA production of EuroArts Music in co-production with ZDF\nFundación Barenboim-Said\nin cooperation with ARTE\nin co-production with\nZDF\n\n© 2008, EuroArts Music International","Duration":"01:37:31","ChannelName":"EuroArtsChannel","VideoId":"nPTMTP7fNZ0","ChannelId":"UCt7SG8q4GUDMLfbkViwkWLQ"},{"Title":"Daniel Barenboim - Bartok : Piano Concerto No.1  (1967)","Description":"Pierre  Boulez cond. / New Philharmonia Orch.\n1.

The founding fathers of WEDO were the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, who himself comes from a Jewish family, and the Palestinian literary academic and pianist Edward Said, who passed away in 2003. Their goal from the very beginning was to use music to facilitate a dialog between cultures, and especially between Israeli and Arab musicians. While Barenboim and Said had described their joint project as “virtually impossible” at the outset, it is now apparent that the musicians understand each other exceptionally well!\n\nEvery summer, the Israeli and Arab musicians and the conductor come together for rehearsals, workshops and a major concert tour. The orchestra has performed all over the world, but not in the home countries of many of its musicians. They have never been allowed to play in Israel, and only a few times in Arab countries. The orchestra is often called a “peace orchestra”, but Barenboim and the musicians want it to be understood as a humanistic rather than a political project.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Deutsche Welle, Daniel Barenboim talks about what is special about the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. How do Israeli and Arab musicians get along with each other? How does the orchestra work as a team? The interview also addresses Barenboim’s special relationship to Beethoven, concerts during the pandemic, and the question of what role music can play in today’s world. For Barenboim, the answer is clear: music is an art form that overcomes divides, and in which people from hostile nations can create something together.\n\nThe video features longer excerpts from these concerts by Daniel Barenboim and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra:\n- Ludwig van Beethoven: Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67 (Royal Albert Hall, London, 2012)\n- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Symphony No. 39 in E-flat major, K. 543 (United Nations Human Rights Room, Geneva, 2015)\n- Ludwig van Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op 125 (Royal Albert Hall, London, 2012) \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\nWatch more portraits of classical musicians: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBUGCdoVYLjdUZa_L1OU6tMD\n\nThumbnail: © picture-alliance/dpa | Mohamed Omar\n\n#DanielBarenboim #WestEasternDivanOrchestra #Beethoven","Duration":"00:21:53","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"__vqx4yfo1M","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Daniel Barenboim conducts Mozart and Beethoven","Description":"Wiener Philharmoniker \nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nProgram\nMozart Piano Concerto No.27 in B major, KV 595\nBeethoven Symphony No.5","Duration":"01:16:39","ChannelName":"MusicArchive","VideoId":"PyYNq3PTQYI","ChannelId":"UClRW46ByFKhUJFBtKn0mOeA"},{"Title":"Daniel Barenboim plays Brahms Piano Concerto #2 - (1965)","Description":"Paul Kletzki leads the Los Angeles Philharmonic with the young 22 year-old Daniel Barenboim in this performance from 1965 of the Piano Concerto No. 2 in B♭ Major by Johannes Brahms.\n\nI.

Was this 1/24/80 a different performance than the one on the record that is listed as 1979? I'm not sure. I feel like the copyright claim would have been much more extensive if they were truly the same. Another thing that gives me pause is that there are not any typical vinyl record sounds in this recording - no needle pops, scratches, etc. Maybe WNIB had a high quality tape recording that they broadcast, instead of just playing the record? \n\nIf anyone knows that 1979 record/performance I'd love to hear your thoughts. \n\nIf it is indeed that record - it is on YouTube in several places.

For all its symbolism, and hopefully something rather more than that, the aims and ambitions of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra are first and foremost musical ones: the Middle East’s political divides are eschewed for a union of musical talent, which speaks volumes for cultural interaction. Once the music starts, that is what matters. And it mattered considerably at this concert, the orchestra’s members fresh from a residency in Seville – radiating learning and conviction, and sharing the wonderful power of music in no uncertain terms. In this live recording from a concert in the Victoria Hall in Geneva two familiar masterworks were presented with significant import, Beethoven’s 3rd piano concerto and Tchaikovsky's famous 5th Symphony. As an encore, we also hear the overture from Verdi's La Forza del destino and Jean Sibelius' \"Valse triste\".\n\nDirected by Bob Cole\n\nA production of EuroArts Music International\nIn Coproduction with Fundación tres Culturas del Mediterráneo\n\n© 2004 EuroArts Music International","Duration":"00:46:21","ChannelName":"EuroArtsChannel","VideoId":"eLfatDf_kY4","ChannelId":"UCt7SG8q4GUDMLfbkViwkWLQ"},{"Title":"Tchaikovsky : Symphony No.4    D.Barenboim/NHK Symphony O.(1973)","Description":"Tchaikovsky : Symphony No.4 \n1st movement   00:00\n2nd    17:30\n3rd     26:40\n4st     32:27\n\nD.Barenboim/NHK Symphony orchestra 4/4/1973 Tokyo live\nチャイコフスキー「交響曲第4番」\nダニエル・バレンボイム指揮\u3000NHK交響楽団\n1973年4月4日\u3000東京文化会館ライブ録音\n\n今や伝説的となっているバレンボイム唯一のN響との協演によるチャイコフスキーです。","Duration":"00:41:26","ChannelName":"Isappin","VideoId":"HvvQOiqodKQ","ChannelId":"UC_W-zQQHNRLW1QHWQAF9B_A"},{"Title":"Tchaikovsky Piano Trio Op 50 Du Pre Barenboim Zuckerman LIVE","Description":"Tchaikovsky Piano Trio Op 50 Du Pre Barenboim Zuckerman LIVE  ","Duration":"00:43:13","ChannelName":"jkircher314","VideoId":"N1KBzJC_9no","ChannelId":"UCffeJW6Am_dqsk_6Eonfflw"},{"Title":"Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 4 (1997) - Complete - Daniel Barenboim - Chicago Symphony Orchestra","Description":"My favorite symphony by my favorite composer, conducted by my favorite conductor.

Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 captivates audiences with its powerful opening chords and lyrical melodies. Here, the iconic piece is performed by pianist Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin, conducted by Zubin Mehta. The concert took place on 15 November 2012 at the Berliner Philharmonie to mark Daniel Barenboim's 70th birthday.\n\n(00:00) Arrival on stage \n(00:26) I. Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso  \n(23:22) II. Andantino semplice  \n(31:03) III. Allegro con fuoco  \n \nBy the early 1870s, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) had already achieved some fame in Moscow and St Petersburg. Several of his operas had been well received, but the Russian composer also attracted attention with orchestral works such as the two Shakespeare-inspired fantasies 'The Tempest' and 'Romeo and Juliet', and chamber music such as the First String Quartet. Now, with his First Piano Concerto, Tchaikovsky wanted to open up a new genre.\n\nHowever, Tchaikovsky was initially unsure. In a letter to his brother Anatol in December 1874, he wrote: \"The work is progressing very slowly and does not really want to succeed. But I remain true to my principles and force my mind to work out piano passages: The result is mild nervousness'. It was a real challenge for him to write the Piano Concerto, as there were no models for it in Russia at the time. Almost inevitably, Tchaikovsky could not avoid giving the impression of being a 'Westerner', for whom the connection with the Viennese Classical music of Mozart or Beethoven, or the Romanticism of Chopin or Liszt, was more important than any orientation towards his own Russian traditions. \n\nThe formal design of his Piano Concerto No. 1 could support this claim, given that Tchaikovsky followed a classical pattern in composing it: a broadly conceived fast first movement with motivic and thematic contrasts, followed by a cantabile slow movement of great expressiveness, while the rondo finale is overtly virtuosic in tone. In terms of melodic material, however, Tchaikovsky was very much in touch with his homeland: In the two outer movements, he uses themes influenced by Slavic folklore. \n\nTchaikovsky originally intended to dedicate the First Piano Concerto to his friend and mentor Nikolai Rubinstein, who was to give the first performance, but the famous Moscow pianist didn't like it, telling Tchaikovsky that \"the concerto is bad, unplayable, the phrases hackneyed and clumsy, the ideas weak\".\n\nTchaikovsky asked another prominent pianist, Hans von Bülow if he would be willing to play the piano concerto.  He responded enthusiastically. Unlike Rubinstein, von Bülow found many original ideas, a perfect sense of form and a wealth of interesting details in the work. Von Bülow gratefully accepted Tchaikovsky's dedication and performed the work at its premiere in Boston in 1875. The performance was a real triumph for Tchaikovsky with the final movement repeated on all six evenings. Following the USA, the work went on to conquer Russia and Europe.   \n\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1942, Daniel Barenboim is one of the great artists of our time. As a pianist and conductor, he has performed in the major cities of Europe and the world for decades, and as the founder of numerous projects, including the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, Barenboim has greatly enriched the international music scene. Daniel Barenboim was General Music Director of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin from the end of 1991 until January 2023, and in the autumn of 2000 he was elected Chief Conductor of the Staatskapelle Berlin for life.\n\nLike his friend Daniel Barenboim, Zubin Mehta is considered a cosmopolitan and world-class musician. Born in Bombay in 1936, Mehta studied conducting at the Vienna Academy of Music and was soon conducting both the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras as well as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. He has been closely associated with all three ensembles ever since. In 1978 he was appointed Music Director of the New York Philharmonic. His tenure there lasted 13 years, the longest in the orchestra's history. Mehta was still conducting the Berliner Philharmoniker in 2023 at the age of 87.\n\nThe Staatskapelle Berlin is one of the oldest orchestras in the world. Originally founded as a court orchestra by Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg in 1570, the ensemble found its artistic home in the Royal Court Opera House Unter den Linden when it was opened by Frederick II of Prussia in 1742.\n\n© 2012 Accentus/Unitel\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nand check out more piano concertos here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNcQGsF2uIw&list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU7k2TJgrgNCc9aygnNkaGZ\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#pianoconcerto #tchaikovsky #classicalpiano","Duration":"00:39:16","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"oO58lNdEvnk","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto no. 2 (Cherkassky; Toronto S.O./Herbig)","Description":"Tchaikovsky's second piano concerto, performed by Shura Cherkassky with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra conducted by Günther Herbig.

I. Schwer, pesante\n33:38. II. Adagio \n\nDaniel Barenboim, piano\nZubin Mehta, Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra\n1971, live\n\nThis concerto is a colossal work, stemming from the great german romanticism of Brahms, Bruckner and Wagner. The influence of this authors is clearly audible in this work, but it's not dry or unoriginal. Furtwängler in fact is able to converge all of these Brahmsian melodies with Brucknerian textures and Wagnerian harmony... creating an intense dash of raw emotion, reaching climaxes comparable to, dare I say, Mahler's late symphonies. There are brief moments of luminosity and tranquility, but they don't last very long, interrupted by the almost constant storm of emotions of this epic and dark work. \n\nThe Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in B minor by Wilhelm Furtwängler was composed between 1924 and 1937. Its world premiere took place in Munich on October 26, 1937, with Edwin Fischer as soloist; Furtwängler conducted the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In January 1939 there was a radio broadcast which has survived as the only complete recording of the original version of the concerto.\n\nThe work is cast into three movements: The first (Schwer, pesante in B minor) is an extensive sonata form movement of more than 30 minutes duration. A second movement there follows an Adagio solenne in D major influenced by Bruckner and Brahms; and lasting approximately 11 minutes. The last movement (Allegro moderato in B minor) is composed in free-form and has some hints of a rondo. Its duration is about 20 minutes and the work concludes in dark and gloomy mood with pianissimo dynamics.\n\nAs a result of its ambivalent reception and technical difficulty, Furtwängler's Symphonic Concerto has rarely been performed in public. Extensive revisions were made to the score prior to its publication by Brucknerverlag of Wiesbaden in 1954. This is the version that has been performed since.\n\n\n*I'm sorry about not being able to include the 3rd movement in the video, but apparently there are different versions of the score, and the one which I have doesn't align completely with audio of the recording used in the video.","Duration":"00:45:30","ChannelName":"Scriabin is my Dog","VideoId":"26rxEV3IsJs","ChannelId":"UCmzOLCPZMqb86O2kg-uDcww"},{"Title":"York Höller: AURA (1992/1996) for large orchestra.
