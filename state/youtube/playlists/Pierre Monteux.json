Sitting before them is noone less than Edvard Grieg.\n\nMonteux remained attached to Francks music for his whole life, and made multiple (glorious) studio versions of this piece. He disliked the lack of spontanteity he often heard on records. Here is a live version (radio recording with the orchestra of the French Radio).\n\nHe believed in adherence to the score, but without ever souding stiff or dull. His credo was: \u201COur principal work is to keep the orchestra together and carry out the composer\u2019s instructions, not to be sartorial models, cause dowagers to swoon, or distract audiences by our \u2018interpretation.\u2019\u201D And it works...",

His original inspiration was based upon the form of Orientalism that was so popular in Russia at the time.\n\nOf course, the work was an immediate favorite with audiences and brought him world renown, but later in life he indicated that he preferred that people think of it as a symphonic suite instead of music based on \u00221001 Arabian Nights\u0022. \n\nThe present recording from 1942 is just as interesting for its sound as the performance which, being by Monteux, is excellent.\n\nWhy the decision was made to make a recording in a hall with a very noticeable acoustic slap is anybody\u0027s guess.
