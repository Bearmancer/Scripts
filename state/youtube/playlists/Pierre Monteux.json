He heard his teacher Jules (Solomon) Garcin conduct the premiere of this symphony and shared a first prize in violin playing with Jacques Thibaud in 1896.\nHe conducted from the age of 12, accompaning Alfred Cortot (two years younger!) in concerti. \nHe worked for a long time as first violist and conducting assistant with Edouard (Juda) Colonne. \n\nHe was also an avid chamber music player, here we see him as violist with Johannes, Wolff, Gustave Lijon and André Dulaurons. Sitting before them is noone less than Edvard Grieg.\n\nMonteux remained attached to Francks music for his whole life, and made multiple (glorious) studio versions of this piece. He disliked the lack of spontanteity he often heard on records. Here is a live version (radio recording with the orchestra of the French Radio).\n\nHe believed in adherence to the score, but without ever souding stiff or dull. His credo was: “Our principal work is to keep the orchestra together and carry out the composer’s instructions, not to be sartorial models, cause dowagers to swoon, or distract audiences by our ‘interpretation.’” And it works...",

His original inspiration was based upon the form of Orientalism that was so popular in Russia at the time.\n\nOf course, the work was an immediate favorite with audiences and brought him world renown, but later in life he indicated that he preferred that people think of it as a symphonic suite instead of music based on \"1001 Arabian Nights\". \n\nThe present recording from 1942 is just as interesting for its sound as the performance which, being by Monteux, is excellent.\n\nWhy the decision was made to make a recording in a hall with a very noticeable acoustic slap is anybody's guess. Perhaps it was thought that the slap would make the horn solos even more dramatic, which it does.",
