    "Description": "Daniil Trifonov @daniiltrifonov \nLos Angeles Philharmonic @laphil / Susanna M\u00E4lkki - \nJohannes Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2 in B\u266D major, Op. 83 (1881) \n\nWalt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, USA / Feb. 23-25, 2024 \nBroadcast on KUSC with Brian Lauritzen on May 12, 2024\n\nhttps://www.kusc.org/shows/SoCal-Sunday-Night \n\n00:00 I. Allegro non troppo\n19:26 II. Allegro appassionato \n28:16 III. Andante \n40:42 IV. Allegretto grazioso - Un poco pi\u00F9 presto \n\n49:41 Applause  \n\n50:40 [Encore with Robert deMaine] Chopin\u0027s Cello Sonata: III. Largo \n\n54:51 Applause   \n\n\nMichael M. Landman-Karny\u0027s Review: \n\n\u0022Daniil Trifonov, a Russian pianist distinguished by his shoulder-length hair and beard, giving him the appearance of a mystical prophet, stands among the foremost pianists of our time. His performance of Brahms\u2019s monumental concerto did not disappoint.\n\nThe first movement, Allegro non Troppo (Fast but not overly so) has a famously evocative opening, the principal horn (beautifully played by David Cooper) presented the first sounds of the movement\u2019s main theme. Trifonov on the piano seamlessly picked up the musical conversation as a soloist, leading into extended, triumphant piano solos interchanged with the orchestra. What stood out was Trifonov\u2019s ability to sustain the expansive lines of the movement, maintaining a coherent narrative amidst the complexity of Brahms\u2019s musical ideas. The cadenza was a highlight, showcasing Trifonov\u2019s virtuosity and emotional depth, while seamlessly integrating with the thematic material of the movement. Under M\u00E4lkki\u2019s direction, the LA Phil harmonized dynamic shifts from the podium, meshing seamlessly with the nuanced exchange between pianist and orchestra.\n\nThe second movement is marked Allegro Appassionato (passionately brisk) and is a mostly tumultuous movement. Trifonov delved into the passionate and stormy character of the music with full force, his fingers traversing the keyboard with agility and precision. The contrasts between the tumultuous and more lyrical sections were handled with great finesse. Trifonov\u2019s dynamic control was remarkable, moving from thunderous climaxes to moments of tender intimacy without losing the thread of the movement\u2019s forward momentum. The orchestra beautifully harmonized with the piano creating a lush wall of sound.\n\nThe third movement, marked Andante (Slow), is where the heart of Brahms\u2019 concerto lies. This movement stands out for its unique incorporation of an extensive cello solo within the framework of a piano concerto. Robert DeMaine, exquisite on Cello, played the theme for the first three minutes before the piano came in. Trifonov navigated the movement\u2019s emotional landscapes with a moving sensitivity and depth. His touch on the piano was at once gentle and decisive, allowing the melody to unfold with a clarity and warmth that seemed to embrace the listener. The orchestra provided a lush, responsive backdrop to Trifonov\u2019s playing. The strings were particularly notable for their velvety tone, weaving in and out of the piano\u2019s narrative with grace and precision. The woodwinds added layers of texture and conversation, echoing the piano\u2019s themes and expanding on them with their own voices.\n\nThe concerto culminated with the fourth movement, marked Allegretto grazioso (fairly fast, graciously), bursting forth with a spirited Hungarian folk-dance motif. The finale showcased Trifonov\u2019s dazzling technical prowess, as the piano and orchestra engaged in a thrilling exchange of themes, culminating in a triumphant finale that had the audience jumping to their feet.\n\nFor his one encore, Trifonov played the Chopin Cello Sonata with Robert DeMaine on the cello.  It was short but beautiful and left this reviewer wishing for more encores.\n\nUnlike some of his contemporaries, such as Yuja Wang and Lang Lang, Trifonov isn\u2019t heavily hyped by his publicity team.  Trifonov\u2019s effortless gimmick-free technique, however, solidifies his position as one of the greatest living pianists. The combination of M\u00E4lkki, Trifonov and the best-in-class Los Angeles Philharmonic made this a night to remember.\u0022 \n\nLev Mamuya\u0027s Review: \n\n\u0022His playing in the second-movement scherzo, buttressed by cutting, responsive figures in the strings, was deeply satisfying, and his touch at the outset of the finale was dry but graceful - the interpretation tended toward singing, delicate, and contemplative.\u0022\n\n#DaniilTrifonov \n#SusannaM\u00E4lkki\n#Malkki #M\u00E4lkki   \n#RobertdeMaine\n#Brahms \n#LAPhil \n#WaltDisneyConcertHall  \n#JohannesBrahms \n#BrahmsPianoConcerto \n#PianoConcerto",
