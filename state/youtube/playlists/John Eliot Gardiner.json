    "Title": "Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 2 | London Symphony Orchestra \u0026 Sir John Eliot Gardiner",
    "Description": "A symphony based on a series of Ukrainian folk songs: Symphony No. 2 in C minor, Op. 17 by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The catchy symphony is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir John Eliot Gardiner. The concert took place on July 5, 2022, at St Luke\u0027s Church in London.\n\n(00:00) I. Andante sostenuto \u2013 Allegro vivo \n(11:16) II. Andantino marziale, quasi moderato \n(18:09) III. Scherzo. Allegro molto vivace \n(23:23) IV. Finale. Moderato assai \u2013 Allegro vivo \n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\u0027s (1840\u20131893) Symphony No. 2 in C minor, Op. 17, is also known by the nickname \u201CLittle Russian.\u201D A friend of Tchaikovsky\u0027s gave the 2nd Symphony this name because its themes and motifs are based on several Ukrainian folk songs. The romantic composer heard these folk songs while on summer vacation with his sister in an area that today belongs to Ukraine but was called \u201CLittle Russia\u201D during Tchaikovsky\u0027s lifetime in the Russian Empire. In none of his other six symphonies did Tchaikovsky take so many motifs and themes from folk songs. The \u201CLittle Russian Symphony\u201D is thus quite elaborate. \n\nTchaikovsky composed his Second Symphony between June and November 1872, and it premiered on February 7, 1873, in Moscow, conducted by his friend Nikolai Rubinstein. Both the audience and critics celebrated the symphony, even calling it a \u201Cnational achievement.\u201D This label was considered a special mark of quality, especially in the 19th century. In various European countries, music in a supposedly national musical language had become fashionable. This usually meant using elements from the folk music of the respective country in compositions. In Russia, a circle of renowned composers had even formed to promote Russian national music. They called themselves \u201CThe Mighty Five\u201D (also \u201CThe Five\u201D or \u201CThe Mighty Handful\u201D). Tchaikovsky was not a member of this group; in fact, he expressly distanced himself from \u201CThe Five.\u201D Nevertheless, his Symphony No. 2 certainly meets the criteria of a \u201Cnational\u201D music of some kind.  \n\nThe popularity of Tchaikovsky\u0027s 2nd Symphony did not prevent the Russian Romantic composer from reworking it a few years later. Tchaikovsky confided to his pen pal and patron Nadezhda von Meck that he considered the symphony immature and mediocre. He had decided that he needed to rewrite it. The revised version was written between December 1879 and January 1880. The significantly altered Second Symphony was first performed in St. Petersburg in 1881. This version of the symphony was also well received by audiences, particularly because of its rich melodies. It is this second version of the \u201CLittle Russian Symphony\u201D that is still performed today.\n\n\u00A9 2022 C Major Entertainment\n\nWatch more concerts:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nFamous symphonies:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWJ5t7LxFkBRlcTu4qHdo67\n\nOther pieces by Tchaikovsky:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBXeqiLcYJCB2Ct1lqIDtivN\n\nMore music of the Romantic period:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBUCHNKKxIIM88sntDk1TVih\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#symphony #romanticmusic #tchaikovsky",
