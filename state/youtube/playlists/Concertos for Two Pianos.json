    "Description": "Colin McPhee (CA): Tabuh-Tabuhan (1936) \nFor two pianos and orchestra \nAlex Pauk, C.M. | Conductor \nWesley Shen \u0026 Stephanie Chua | Pianos \n\nLive performance, recorded January 25th, 2023 at Koerner Hall, Toronto. \n\nComposer Note:\n\nTabuh-Tabuhan was composed in Mexico in 1936, and performed before the ink was barely dry by Carlos Chavez and the National Orchestra of Mexico City. It was written after I had already spent four years in Bali engaged in musical research, and is largely inspired, especially in its orchestration, by the various methods I had learned of Balinese gamelan technic. The title of the work derives from the Baliness word tabuh, originally meaning the mallet used for striking a percussion instrument, but extended to mean strike or beat - the drum, a gong xylophone or metallophone. Tabuh-Tabuhan is thus a Balinese collective noun, meaning different drum rhythms, metric forms, gong punctuations, gamelans, and music essentially percussive.\n\nAlthough Tabuh-Tabuhan makes much use of Balinese musical material. I consider it a purely personal work in which Balinese and composed motifs, melodies and rhythms have been fused to a symphonic work. Balinese music never rises to an emotional climax, but at the same time has a terrific rhythmic drive and symphonic surge, and this partly influenced me in planning the form of the work. Many of the syncopated rhythms of Balinese music have a close affinity with those of Latin American popular music and American jazz - a history in itself - these have formed the basic impulse of the work from start to finish.\n\nTo transfer the intricate chime-like polyphonic figuration of the gamelan keyed instruments and gong-chimes, I have used a \u0027nuclear gamelan\u0027 composed of two pianos, celesta, xylophone, marimba and glockenspiel. These form the core of the orchestra.\n\nIn form, Tabuh-Tabuhan is more or less that of the classical symphony- there being three movements, Ostinatos, Nocturne, and Finale. There is no place here to point out all the purely Baliness motifs. The flute melody in the Nocturne is an entirely Baliness flute melody, taken down as played. The syncopated finale is based on the gay music of a xylophone orchestra which accompanies a popular street dance. This is heard in its most authentic form at the beginning of the work and given the grand treatment at the end.\n\n\u2014Colin McPhee",

    "Description": "Henk Badings (1907-1987)\n\nConcert : voor twee piano\u0027s en orkest (1964)\n\n1. Lento-Allegro - 00:00\n2. Lento - 10:13\n3. Presto - 17:40\n\nEllen Corver, piano\nSepp Grotenhuis, piano\nOrchestra: Radio Symfonie Orkest\nConductor: Kees Bakels\n\n\nBorn of Dutch parents in Java, Henk Badings went to the Netherlands in 1915 as an orphan. His wish to follow a musical career met with strong opposition from his guardian, who forced him to train at the Technical University in Delft. He graduated with honours in 1931 and was appointed demonstrator in palaeontology and historical geology there. During his student years he had been teaching himself composition and music theory, and in 1930 he sat for an examination set by Pijper. He then studied composition with Pijper for a time, but this contact was not particularly fruitful because of their widely differing views. Pijper did, however, stimulate Badings to write a major symphonic work, his prize winning First Symphony (later withdrawn), whose first performance by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1930 aroused the interest of press and public in the then completely unknown composer. In 1933 Eduard van Beinum conducted his Second Symphony and in 1935 his Third was given its premi\u00E8re by the Concertgebouw under Mengelberg, followed by the Symphonic Variations, and the Second Violin Concerto.\nIn 1934 Badings was appointed lecturer in composition and theory at the Rotterdam Conservatory, and in 1937 he became co-director of the Amsterdam Muzieklyceum, his special task being the reorganization of the system of instruction. From 1941 to 1945, during the German occupation, he directed the State Conservatory in The Hague; he was subsequently punished for holding the post and banned for some years from public life, though in 1948 the Concertgebouw Orchestra commissioned him to write his Sixth Symphony. Until 1961, Badings mainly lived as a freelance composer. In 1960--1961 he directed the electronic music studio at the University of Utrecht and was appointed there in 1961 to teach acoustics (until 1977). From that period his reputation as an outstanding teacher began to spread abroad; he had already achieved international renown as a composer. He was professor of composition at the Staatliche Hochschule f\u00FCr Musik, Stuttgart (1962--1972), and gave lectures at the University of Adelaide (1962--1963), in addition to numerous lectures in the USA and South Africa.",
