Stephenson\u0027s bass trombone concerto: \n\u201CIt\u2019s a wonderful piece, which I enjoyed more and more throughout the week. It\u2019s truly a well-crafted piece.\u201C\nJames himself writes in the program notes:\n\u0022When Charlie Vernon first told me in November of 2015 that I would be writing a new bass trombone concerto for him, he highlighted two things: 1) that it be the \u201Cmost profound, beautiful and lasting musical event to be played on the bass trombone\u201D (thanks, Charlie, I\u2019ll do my best\u2026) and 2) that it would be \u201Ca great story, like a book you can\u2019t stop reading.\u201D As I thought about these requirements, I began to think about something I consider pretty profound: life itself. Perhaps this is because at the time of the world premiere I will be 50 years old, when one starts thinking about such heavy subjects; but suffice it to say that it seemed a good time to write something that heeded the significance of life. In thinking about life, I kept coming back to the rhythms of life, and its ups and downs. This idea spurred on my initial inspiration, and I begin to feel a pulse that would inspire the entire work. A pulse, of course, fits nicely into both worlds: life and music. I coupled this early on with a rising note-motif of A-B-C, which serendipitously couples nicely with Charlie\u2019s idea of this piece being like the reading of a book.\u0022\n\nCOMPOSER: James M.

    "Description": "Mitsuko Uchida is not only at home with her renditions of Beethoven but she actually started out recording and performing the full cycle of Mozart piano sonatas and concertos early on in her career. Most critics still believe that she is at her best with Mozart. One thing is certain: she keeps playing better and gets better looking with every passing year!\n\nWhile the C major concerto has been slightly downplayed by musicologists, it remains not only magisterial but moving -- broad and splendid, yet keenly detailed, in the first movement; touchingly and sweet in the slow movement, with its huge, expressively vocal leaps in the solo part; and filled with gleams and shadows in the animated  finale.  Riccardo Muti is conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\nWho are the greatest Living Pianists? See: https://www.rawassertions.com/the-13-greatest-living-classical-pianists-a-bakers-dozen/",

The first half of this concert comprised the Mozart 34 and Entremont playing Mozart\u0027s Cto 9, separately uploaded in this channel.  There is a commercial recording of the Prokofiev 3 with Philadelphia under Muti from 1990 (nearly 20 years later) on Phillips, which supplies an interesting contrast, but I honestly don\u0027t know what to make of it due to the differing sound pictures.  I am inclined to say that the velvety sound of 1972 has had its plushness shaved down, but that could just be due to Phillips\u0027 early digital sound captured in Philadelphia\u0027s Memorial Hall (in West Fairmount Park), which is pretty harsh and congested in the tutti passages.  (Another shoutout to Messrs. Borkow and Sacks for their sound engineering in these live concerts.)  I would be interested in hearing how others perceive the changes in the Philly sound revealed by those two performances nearly two decades apart.",

    "Title": "R. Schumann - Sinfonia no. 3 op. 97 \u0022Renana\u0022 (Berliner Philharmoniker - Riccardo Muti)",
    "Description": "Nel settembre del 1849 Schumann si era trasferito con la famiglia a D\u00FCsseldorf provenendo da Dresda, dopo anni tormenti e faticosi per la composizione di Genoveva, delle Scene dal Faust, del Manfred, per il turbamento causato dalla morte di Mendelssohn, per l\u0027inquietudine causata dalla rivoluzione del 1848-49. Il compositore aveva quasi quarant\u0027anni, veniva a D\u00FCsseldorf con la carica di Direttore dei concerti, accolto con calore dall\u0027\u00E9lite culturale della citt\u00E0. La Terza Sinfonia in mi bemolle, nota fin dai primi tempi con l\u0027appellativo di \u0022Renana\u0022. La prima esecuzione, con l\u0027opera ancora manoscritta, avvenne nel concerto del 6 febbraio 1851 e suscit\u00F2 accoglienze trionfali, ripetute poco dopo a Colonia; grande impressione la Sinfonia suscit\u00F2 anche a Rotterdam, il 1 dicembre 1853, durante la tourn\u00E9e olandese intrapresa da Schumann con la moglie Clara, e fino ad oggi la \u0022Renana\u0022 \u00E8 rimasta forse la pi\u00F9 amata delle quattro Sinfonie, la pi\u00F9 unitaria e compiuta nel pensiero creativo. La Terza Sinfonia fu abbozzata e strumentata in un mese di lavoro fra il 2 novembre e il 9 dicembre 1850; il quarto movimento recava in origine la didascalia \u0022Im Charakter der Begleitung einer feierlichen Ceremonie\u0022 (\u0022Nel carattere di accompagnamento a una cerimonia solenne\u0022), e con precisione ancora maggiore Schumann dichiar\u00F2 di essere stato influenzato dal rito con cui il vescovo di Colonia von Geissel fu innalzato alla porpora cardinalizia nel venerabile duomo, sacro alla storia tedesca e all\u0027arte gotica. In seguito il compositore lasci\u00F2 cadere ogni titolo, ogni indicazione extramusicale; ma un po\u0027 come nell\u0027Eroica di Beethoven nei confronti del generale Bonaparte, cos\u00EC nella Terza di Schumann il Reno, anzi la \u00ABreligione del Reno\u00BB come l\u0027ha chiamata Bortolotto, resta il f\u00F2mite incancellabile dell\u0027ispirazione, la regione spirituale in cui fermentano i sentimenti e le fantasie. Lo stesso Schumann confermava indirettamente questa polarit\u00E0 tutta ideale quando nel marzo 1851 scriveva all\u0027editore Simrock di Bonn che anzich\u00E9 affidare l\u0027opera a uno dei tanti editori sotto mano a Lipsia, aveva preferito \u00ABvedere apparire proprio qui ai bordi del Reno (cio\u00E8 a Bonn) una grande opera, e proprio questa Sinfonia che forse qua e l\u00E0 rispecchia un pezzo di vita reale\u00BB.\nLa \u00ABreligione del Reno\u00BB schumanniana ha il suo altar maggiore nella Terza Sinfonia; lo si potrebbe circondare con tempietti votivi, quali i Lieder \u0022Sonntags am Rhein\u0022 dell\u0027op. 36 o \u0022Im Rhein, im heiligen Streme\u0022 dalla Dichterliebe di Heine; ci si potrebbe aggiungere il secondo movimento della Fantasia op. 17 per pianoforte, nella stessa tonalit\u00E0 di mi bemolle e con patenti affinit\u00E0 tematiche; la comune cornice della tonalit\u00E0, il ritmo di tre quarti, la simpatia per temi basati sulla triade fondamentale individuano un percorso che muove dall\u0027Eroica di Beethoven, dove l\u0027eroismo \u00E8 tutto astratto, ideale, energia pura: in Schumann l\u0027eroe si \u00E8 concretizzato nella storia e geografia del padre Reno, del duomo di Colonia che vi si specchia, della nazione tedesca che avrebbe potuto esservi consacrata. \u00C8 soprattutto il primo movimento che non maschera il suo riferimento a Beethoven, ma pi\u00F9 nei temi che nel reale sviluppo: \u00E8 sintomatico infatti che il momento supremo di tutta la pagina, quando il tema d\u0027apertura sfolgora nell\u0027unisono dei quattro corni entro l\u0027armonia di mi bemolle tenuta in pianissimo dagli altri strumenti, avvenga nella preparazione della ripresa, in un raccordo strumentale, non deputato a ricevere simili epifanie; \u00E8 un po\u0027 la mentalit\u00E0 del poema sinfonico che perfino nel \u0022classico\u0022 Schumann viene a turbare i recinti della forma-sonata. Nel secondo movimento il Reno si spoglia dei suoi attributi mitici e indossa abiti borghesi, quelli di salubri passeggiate domenicali, allietate da robuste bevute. Il terzo movimento (Nicht schnell, Non veloce) precorre nel tenero clima espressivo il tipo dell\u0027\u0022Andantino\u0022 o \u0022Allegretto\u0022 brahmsiano; il ruolo dell\u0027Adagio, finora scoperto, \u00E8 assolto dal quarto movimento (Feierlich, Solenne) che sarebbe giusto considerare un\u0027ampia introduzione al Finale: le arcaiche sonorit\u00E0 dei tromboni, impiegati qui per la prima volta, i temi dall\u0027austero profilo bachiano, la densit\u00E0 dell\u0027intreccio polifonico, caricano di solennit\u00E0 storica questa pagina, legata nella fantasia di Schumann al fascino del rito cattolico nel duomo di Colonia. Dal suo ultimo accordo, in un opaco mi bemolle minore, si sprigiona il tema in maggiore del movimento finale: che \u00E8 di vivida vena popolaresca, con toni leggeri da Scherzo mendelssohniano irrobustiti verso la fine in sonori giubili di tutta l\u0027orchestra, in architettonica risposta all\u0027esordio del primo movimento.

This was recorded live off the radio onto tape by Mr. Marchant\u2019s daughter. \n\nThis tape required some processing to be playable, which means the quality is not as good as I would want it to be. See the technical notes below for more information. There was a taping error at the very end of the piece where another piece of music came in (radio station changed?) for half a second. I edited it out but couldn\u2019t make it completely transparent. \n\nThere is a big space between the end of the piece and the applause where I can picture Muti holding the baton as long as possible to evoke the dramatic end of a dramatic piece. It\u2019s a neat moment.\n\nI\u0027ve created a Muti playlist since I have a few of his performances on the channel now:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhut5IVLHxGawzTegUoK6pEd-ADT8_70u\n\nTechnical Info:\nAmpex 1800, quarter track stereo\n7\u201D reel\n3 3/4 IPS\nThis tape suffers from sticky shed syndrome which means it has to be specially treated before being played. That process can result in some audio problems unfortunately. With this track there are some balance issues where the left channel is quieter than the right. I tried to adjust for this but there is only so much you can do. For more about the sticky shed treatment see my post here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxh8TfxsulklceOY2PnuGTzfKIjI7Wvxiv",
