    "Description": "Riccardo Muti, conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, said about James M. Stephenson's bass trombone concerto: \n“It’s a wonderful piece, which I enjoyed more and more throughout the week. It’s truly a well-crafted piece.“\nJames himself writes in the program notes:\n\"When Charlie Vernon first told me in November of 2015 that I would be writing a new bass trombone concerto for him, he highlighted two things: 1) that it be the “most profound, beautiful and lasting musical event to be played on the bass trombone” (thanks, Charlie, I’ll do my best…) and 2) that it would be “a great story, like a book you can’t stop reading.” As I thought about these requirements, I began to think about something I consider pretty profound: life itself. Perhaps this is because at the time of the world premiere I will be 50 years old, when one starts thinking about such heavy subjects; but suffice it to say that it seemed a good time to write something that heeded the significance of life. In thinking about life, I kept coming back to the rhythms of life, and its ups and downs. This idea spurred on my initial inspiration, and I begin to feel a pulse that would inspire the entire work. A pulse, of course, fits nicely into both worlds: life and music. I coupled this early on with a rising note-motif of A-B-C, which serendipitously couples nicely with Charlie’s idea of this piece being like the reading of a book.\"\n\nCOMPOSER: James M. Stephenson\nCONDUCTOR: Riccardo Muti\nBASS TROMBONE: Charles Vernon\nORCHESTRA: Chicago Symphony Orchestra\n\nTRACKLIST:\n0:00 - I. Chapter 1\n10:39 - II.

    "Description": "Mitsuko Uchida is not only at home with her renditions of Beethoven but she actually started out recording and performing the full cycle of Mozart piano sonatas and concertos early on in her career. Most critics still believe that she is at her best with Mozart. One thing is certain: she keeps playing better and gets better looking with every passing year!\n\nWhile the C major concerto has been slightly downplayed by musicologists, it remains not only magisterial but moving -- broad and splendid, yet keenly detailed, in the first movement; touchingly and sweet in the slow movement, with its huge, expressively vocal leaps in the solo part; and filled with gleams and shadows in the animated  finale.  Riccardo Muti is conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\nWho are the greatest Living Pianists? See: https://www.rawassertions.com/the-13-greatest-living-classical-pianists-a-bakers-dozen/",

The first half of this concert comprised the Mozart 34 and Entremont playing Mozart's Cto 9, separately uploaded in this channel.  There is a commercial recording of the Prokofiev 3 with Philadelphia under Muti from 1990 (nearly 20 years later) on Phillips, which supplies an interesting contrast, but I honestly don't know what to make of it due to the differing sound pictures.  I am inclined to say that the velvety sound of 1972 has had its plushness shaved down, but that could just be due to Phillips' early digital sound captured in Philadelphia's Memorial Hall (in West Fairmount Park), which is pretty harsh and congested in the tutti passages.  (Another shoutout to Messrs. Borkow and Sacks for their sound engineering in these live concerts.)  I would be interested in hearing how others perceive the changes in the Philly sound revealed by those two performances nearly two decades apart.",

    "Title": "R. Schumann - Sinfonia no. 3 op. 97 \"Renana\" (Berliner Philharmoniker - Riccardo Muti)",
    "Description": "Nel settembre del 1849 Schumann si era trasferito con la famiglia a Düsseldorf provenendo da Dresda, dopo anni tormenti e faticosi per la composizione di Genoveva, delle Scene dal Faust, del Manfred, per il turbamento causato dalla morte di Mendelssohn, per l'inquietudine causata dalla rivoluzione del 1848-49. Il compositore aveva quasi quarant'anni, veniva a Düsseldorf con la carica di Direttore dei concerti, accolto con calore dall'élite culturale della città. La Terza Sinfonia in mi bemolle, nota fin dai primi tempi con l'appellativo di \"Renana\". La prima esecuzione, con l'opera ancora manoscritta, avvenne nel concerto del 6 febbraio 1851 e suscitò accoglienze trionfali, ripetute poco dopo a Colonia; grande impressione la Sinfonia suscitò anche a Rotterdam, il 1 dicembre 1853, durante la tournée olandese intrapresa da Schumann con la moglie Clara, e fino ad oggi la \"Renana\" è rimasta forse la più amata delle quattro Sinfonie, la più unitaria e compiuta nel pensiero creativo. La Terza Sinfonia fu abbozzata e strumentata in un mese di lavoro fra il 2 novembre e il 9 dicembre 1850; il quarto movimento recava in origine la didascalia \"Im Charakter der Begleitung einer feierlichen Ceremonie\" (\"Nel carattere di accompagnamento a una cerimonia solenne\"), e con precisione ancora maggiore Schumann dichiarò di essere stato influenzato dal rito con cui il vescovo di Colonia von Geissel fu innalzato alla porpora cardinalizia nel venerabile duomo, sacro alla storia tedesca e all'arte gotica. In seguito il compositore lasciò cadere ogni titolo, ogni indicazione extramusicale; ma un po' come nell'Eroica di Beethoven nei confronti del generale Bonaparte, così nella Terza di Schumann il Reno, anzi la «religione del Reno» come l'ha chiamata Bortolotto, resta il fòmite incancellabile dell'ispirazione, la regione spirituale in cui fermentano i sentimenti e le fantasie. Lo stesso Schumann confermava indirettamente questa polarità tutta ideale quando nel marzo 1851 scriveva all'editore Simrock di Bonn che anziché affidare l'opera a uno dei tanti editori sotto mano a Lipsia, aveva preferito «vedere apparire proprio qui ai bordi del Reno (cioè a Bonn) una grande opera, e proprio questa Sinfonia che forse qua e là rispecchia un pezzo di vita reale».\nLa «religione del Reno» schumanniana ha il suo altar maggiore nella Terza Sinfonia; lo si potrebbe circondare con tempietti votivi, quali i Lieder \"Sonntags am Rhein\" dell'op. 36 o \"Im Rhein, im heiligen Streme\" dalla Dichterliebe di Heine; ci si potrebbe aggiungere il secondo movimento della Fantasia op. 17 per pianoforte, nella stessa tonalità di mi bemolle e con patenti affinità tematiche; la comune cornice della tonalità, il ritmo di tre quarti, la simpatia per temi basati sulla triade fondamentale individuano un percorso che muove dall'Eroica di Beethoven, dove l'eroismo è tutto astratto, ideale, energia pura: in Schumann l'eroe si è concretizzato nella storia e geografia del padre Reno, del duomo di Colonia che vi si specchia, della nazione tedesca che avrebbe potuto esservi consacrata. È soprattutto il primo movimento che non maschera il suo riferimento a Beethoven, ma più nei temi che nel reale sviluppo: è sintomatico infatti che il momento supremo di tutta la pagina, quando il tema d'apertura sfolgora nell'unisono dei quattro corni entro l'armonia di mi bemolle tenuta in pianissimo dagli altri strumenti, avvenga nella preparazione della ripresa, in un raccordo strumentale, non deputato a ricevere simili epifanie; è un po' la mentalità del poema sinfonico che perfino nel \"classico\" Schumann viene a turbare i recinti della forma-sonata. Nel secondo movimento il Reno si spoglia dei suoi attributi mitici e indossa abiti borghesi, quelli di salubri passeggiate domenicali, allietate da robuste bevute. Il terzo movimento (Nicht schnell, Non veloce) precorre nel tenero clima espressivo il tipo dell'\"Andantino\" o \"Allegretto\" brahmsiano; il ruolo dell'Adagio, finora scoperto, è assolto dal quarto movimento (Feierlich, Solenne) che sarebbe giusto considerare un'ampia introduzione al Finale: le arcaiche sonorità dei tromboni, impiegati qui per la prima volta, i temi dall'austero profilo bachiano, la densità dell'intreccio polifonico, caricano di solennità storica questa pagina, legata nella fantasia di Schumann al fascino del rito cattolico nel duomo di Colonia. Dal suo ultimo accordo, in un opaco mi bemolle minore, si sprigiona il tema in maggiore del movimento finale: che è di vivida vena popolaresca, con toni leggeri da Scherzo mendelssohniano irrobustiti verso la fine in sonori giubili di tutta l'orchestra, in architettonica risposta all'esordio del primo movimento.

    "Description": "The Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Muti performs Edgard Varèse’s symphonic poem Arcana on February 1st, 1985. This was recorded live off the radio onto tape by Mr. Marchant’s daughter. \n\nThis tape required some processing to be playable, which means the quality is not as good as I would want it to be. See the technical notes below for more information. There was a taping error at the very end of the piece where another piece of music came in (radio station changed?) for half a second. I edited it out but couldn’t make it completely transparent. \n\nThere is a big space between the end of the piece and the applause where I can picture Muti holding the baton as long as possible to evoke the dramatic end of a dramatic piece. It’s a neat moment.\n\nI've created a Muti playlist since I have a few of his performances on the channel now:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhut5IVLHxGawzTegUoK6pEd-ADT8_70u\n\nTechnical Info:\nAmpex 1800, quarter track stereo\n7” reel\n3 3/4 IPS\nThis tape suffers from sticky shed syndrome which means it has to be specially treated before being played. That process can result in some audio problems unfortunately. With this track there are some balance issues where the left channel is quieter than the right. I tried to adjust for this but there is only so much you can do. For more about the sticky shed treatment see my post here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxh8TfxsulklceOY2PnuGTzfKIjI7Wvxiv",

    "Title": "Liszt Piano Concerto No 2: Campanella, Muti Philadelphia Orchestra 1984",
    "Description": "Michele Campanella is the featured piano soloist in a Philadelphia Orchestra performance of Franz Liszt’s Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 2 in A major, S.125 in September or October of 1984. Riccardo Muti conducts. This is a recording of a live performance broadcast on the radio and recorded to tape. No date was written on the tape box (other than 1984) so looking up Philadelphia Orchestra performances I see multiple possible dates in late September or early October of 1984. \n\nThis performance does not appear to be on record or on YouTube so I’m happy to have apparently surfaced a lost recording. \n\nTechnical Info:\nRealistic 44-758A, quarter track stereo\n7” reel\n3 3/4 IPS\nThere were some pretty loud scratchy radio crackling noises early in the performance that I managed to mostly remove, but some quiet ones are still there. There is tape degradation apparent in the first minute or so of the recording but it goes away pretty quickly and the rest sounds pretty great, especially for being recorded at the slower speed of 3 3/4 inches per second.",
