Han gikk gjerne lange promenader i skogen for å få inspirasjon og energi, og nøt oppriktig å ferdes blant trær og blomster. En symfoni med naturen som tema var derfor ikke unaturlig for Beethoven, men kontroversielt blant seriøse musikkritikere som så ned på såkalte tonemalerier eller programmusikk. I «Pastoralesymfonien» beskrives så vel fuglekvitter, en sildrende bekk og uvær. Verket pekte fram mot den romantiske perioden der beskrivende og fortellende musikk skulle bli mye mer vanlig.\n\n\n#Beethoven #Symphony #classsicalmusic #SymphonyOrchestra #Concerto #Stutzmann #NathalieStutzmann #Sinfonia #Pastorale #Pastoral #KSO\n\n\n@kildenkrs\n➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/krs.symf/\n➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kildenkrs/\n➡ Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0cVMJ85dH3g80uxwSgCdY4",

    "Title": "Franck: The Accursed Huntsman | Nathalie Stutzmann and the London Symphony Orchestra",
    "Description": "Step into a storm of sound where a defiant horn blast summons tubular bells, savage chases, and a relentless supernatural fate. César Franck’s The Accursed Huntsman (the original French title is Le Chasseur maudit) unfolds vivid storytelling through orchestral color, mounting tension, and a finale that leaves the spine humming—fifteen unforgettable minutes of drama, atmosphere, and raw musical theater. Watch and feel the hunt become the hunted. Here, the romantic piece is performed by Nathalie Stutzmann and the London Symphony Orchestra. The concert took place on November 10, 2022, at the Barbican Centre in London.\n\nCésar Franck's (1822 - 1890) symphonic poem Le Chasseur Maudit, FWV 44 from 1882 is a prime example of so-called program music - instrumental works that are based on a non-musical subject. In the case of The Accursed Huntsman, this is the ballad Der wilde Jäger (The Wild Huntsman) by German poet Gottfried August Bürger (1747 - 1794). The poem tells the story of a Rhineland count who goes hunting on a Sunday morning. This is considered to be sinful behavior because he should have gone to church. The awareness of sin is embodied by two horsemen flanking the count. The rider on the left tempts him to do evil, the one on the right wants him to do good. The count follows the evil one, who clearly is the devil himself, and this leads to a series of terrible crimes from the one initial sin: He has a farmer who admonishes him against hunting flogged and his fields trampled on. He unleashes a murderous bloodbath on a shepherd and his flock. He desecrates the chapel of a hermit. But then the raging hunter finds himself alone in the forest and hears a voice that curses him. As punishment, he is condemned to be hunted by demons for all eternity. The hunter becomes the hunted and experiences hell on earth.\n\nCésar Franck's symphonic poem follows the literary source closely. The dramatic plot develops in four sections:\n\n(00:00) The Peaceful Sunday Landscape (Le Paysage paisible du Dimanche)\n(03:05) The Hunt (La Chasse)\n(08:43) The Curse (La Malédiction)\n(11:16) The Demons‘ Chase (La Poursuite des Démons)\n\nThe defining feature of all the sections is the hunting motif played by the horns right at the beginning. In the course of the one-movement orchestral piece, this striking motif becomes the leitmotif. Its varied forms represent the states of mind of the hunter. In the first section, the hunting motif radiates self-will and pride. It is self-confidently contrasted with the singing of the faithful in the church and the sound of the church bells. The second section sets the scene for the hunt. Franck expresses the hunter's inner conflict between good and evil, so vividly described in Bürger's ballad, by means of an echo: the hunting theme played by the horns is restrainedly repeated by the woodwinds. You immediately sense that something is wrong. As it progresses, the hunting theme is taken over by the whole orchestra, and develops in a propulsive manner becoming increasingly aggressive. Three times the woodwinds counter with a softer melodic motif, which stands for the three victims of the hunter's crimes: the farmer (04:39), the shepherd (6:21) and the hermit (6:46); when the hunter suddenly finds himself alone in the forest and is afraid, the hunting motif is only heard in fragments and muted (07:26). In the third section, the curse against the count is heard in the low winds - but the theme of the curse also proves to be a variant of the hunting motif. In the fourth section, the hunting motif appears in a parodied form. Now it has been taken up by the demons surrounding the Count. The hunter has become the hunted. Shortly before the end of the tone poem, the bell sounds again, this time not as a harmonious church bell but as a monotonous death knell.\n\nWith The Accursed Huntsman, César Franck once again proves himself to be a thoroughly Romantic composer. Popular Romantic subjects such as spooky horror stories with ghosts and supernatural forces or contradictions between outward action and inner states of mind are set to music perfectly here. The Accursed Huntsman is a successful example of how musical means can be used to tell an exciting story.\n\n© 2022 C MAJOR ENTERTAINMENT\n\nCheck out more music from the Romantic period in our playlist ROMANTIC MUSIC:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBUCHNKKxIIM88sntDk1TVih\n\nAnd watch more concerts in YOUR PERSONAL CONCERT HALL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#romanticmusic #hunting #romanticmusic",

    "Title": "Harp Concerto in E-flat major - Reinhold Glière",
    "Description": "WDR Symphony Orchestra conducted by Nathalie Stutzmann. Xavier de Maistre as the harpist.\n\nI - Allegro moderato (𝅘𝅥 = 100) - Meno mosso (𝅘𝅥 = 84) - Tempo I - Più mosso - Cadenza - Più mosso: 0:00\nII - Tema con variazioni. Andante (𝅘𝅥𝅮 = 88) - Largamente cantabile - Molto tranquillo (𝅘𝅥𝅮 = 76) - Allegretto leggiero (𝅘𝅥𝅮 = 120) - Animato (𝅘𝅥𝅮 = 132) - Con molto espressione (𝅘𝅥𝅮 = 72) - Coda. Andante (𝅘𝅥𝅮 = 88): 11:18\nIII - Allegro giocoso (𝅘𝅥 = 120) - Poco pesante - Più mosso - Presto (𝅘𝅥 = 144) - Meno mosso: 21:50\n\nGlière's Harp Concerto was composed in 1938, the same year he was named People’s Artist of the Soviet Union. It was written with close collaboration with Russian harpist Ksenia Erdely, principal harpist of the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. It was premiered in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on November 23 of 1938, performed by the Russian State Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Leonid Steinberg, with Ksenia Erdely as the soloist. The work is still widely performed by virtuoso harpists even today.\n\nErdely's counsel was so helpful that Glière offered to give her credit as co-composer but she refused the honour, instead appearing as editor, as she preferred, when the work was published. Despite being written in 1938, the concerto is heavily anchored in the late Russian tradition to the point it could easily pass as written 50 years prior. It is described by a critic as with \"a heavy dose of Viennese Classicism crossed with Mozartean grace and touch of Russian romantic nationalism.\" This late Russian traditional romanticism married well with the views of soviet authorities, who showered Glière with prizes and honours.\n\nThe first movement is structured in a modified concert sonata form. It begins with a brief orchestral gesture, followed by the introduction of an elegant and florid main theme introduced by the soloist. It culminates in a glowing tutti, after which a short cadenza-like passage composed of brilliant harp arpeggios begins a transition. A widely lyrical second theme is presented by the clarinet supported by the soloist. We find no closing cadence, instead the transition returns as it leads us to the development, which is more dramatic and modulates between several tonalities, not achieving a climax. The harpist then performs a virtuosic cadenza based on fragments of the themes, which merges into a rich inverted recapitulation (the second theme before the main one). A passionate coda ends the movement brilliantly.\n\nThe second movement is written as a set of a theme and six variations. It opens with brooding low strings before the soloist introduces the main theme of Russian folkloric nature. The first variation is an embellishment of the theme. Form, meter, key, and harmony remaining unchanged. A beautiful solo cello offers a lyrical counter melody. The second variation is played by full orchestra without solo harp, with a reverse version of the theme dominated by woodwinds. The third variation features light scales and arpeggios from the harp, decomposing the material in canonic forms. In the  fourth variation tempo quickens. The solo harp plays an accompanimental role to strings and woodwinds with rapid sixty-fourth-note arpeggios.\n\nThe fifth variation again puts the harp to the forefront, with the melody in the right hand thumb doubled by high strings, while the counter melody on the left hand is doubled by low strings. The sixth and final variation opens with violas sharing phrases will the cellos and the melody swifts to violins, all while the harpist accompanies until playing figure arpeggios and retakes it soloist role. The coda begins with the same brooding low string chords, horns reintroducing the main theme in its original shape, which passes to woodwinds and strings while the soloist supports with glissandos and arpeggios. A calm and elegant coda ends the movement, with a big glissando from the harpist.\n\nThe third movement is structured in sonata form. It begins with a brief but expecting orchestral introduction, preceding the exposition of a lively and cheerful main theme by the soloist, soon in dialogue with woodwinds and strings. Then a transition begins with brilliant arpeggios that mark the beginning of a short cadenza. A syncopated tutti leads us to a more expressive and flowing second theme. The ensuing development section is dominated by the main theme, culminating in a climax cut short by the recapitulation of the material. The coda begins with an abrupt quickening of the tempo, with virtuosic harp arpeggios above a lively orchestral accompaniment. A firm coda ends the entire work.\n\nPicture: \"Summer Day\" (1917) by the Russian painter Sergei Vinogradov.\n\nMusical analysis partially written by myself.

Urfremførelsen fant sted i Paris 12. desember 1920. Verket har gjennom musikkhistorien blitt omtalt som en hyllest til valsen, selv om mange har hevdet at det lå en sterk undertone av parodi eller kritikk i verket, myntet på Europas noe aparte borgerskap i og etter første verdenskrig. Ravel selv nektet imidlertid for dette, og uttalte: \"Mens noen oppdager et forsøk på parodi, faktisk karikatur, ser andre kategorisk en tragisk hentydning i det - slutten på det andre imperiet og situasjonen i Wien etter krigen. Denne dansen kan virke tragisk, som enhver annen følelse ... presset til det ytterste. Men man skal bare se i den hva musikken uttrykker: en stigende progresjon av klang, som scenen kommer sammen for å legge til lys og bevegelse.\" \nUansett er dette å anse som et melodisk mesterverk, nyskapende, til tider dissonant, spent til bristepunktet mellom det brutale og det skjøre.\n\n\n\n#Ravel #mauriceravel #Stutzmann #NathalieStutzmann #Concerto #classsicalmusic #SymphonyOrchestra #symphony #Valse #lavalse #KSO\n\n\n@kildenkrs\n➡ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/krs.symf/\n➡ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kildenkrs/\n➡ Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/0cVMJ85dH3g80uxwSgCdY4",

    "Title": "Brahms: Symphony No. 4 | London Symphony Orchestra & Nathalie Stutzmann",
    "Description": "A work full of contradictions that offers a glimpse into the composer's inner world. Johann Brahms was plagued by doubts when he composed his Fourth Symphony in E minor, Op. 98, in 1864/65. But anyone who hears French conductor Nathalie Stutzmann conducting the London Symphony Orchestra would find that hard to believe. The concert was recorded on 10 November 2022 at the Barbican Center, home of the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\n(00:00) I. Allegro non troppo\n(13:40) II. Andante moderato\n(26:08) III. Allegro Giocoso\n(32:29) IV. Allegro energico e passionato – Più Allegro\n\nWhen it came to his symphonies, Johannes Brahms (1833–1897) reverently took cues from his great role model Ludwig van Beethoven. Some of his Romantic contemporaries, such as Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, and Gustav Mahler also took inspiration in Beethoven's symphonies — in part to set themselves apart from the legendary composer. Brahms wrote to conductor Hermann Levi: \"You have no idea how it feels to always hear such a giant marching behind you!\" He was referring to Beethoven's looming presence over his works. \n\nWhile contemporary critics of Brahms' Fourth Symphony claim that the composer still adhered to the form of the classical symphony in a conservative manner, others emphasized his innovations. The conductor Hans von Bülow (1830–1894) described Brahms' Fourth as \"Beethoven's Tenth.\" And Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951), founder of the atonal twelve-tone technique, later wrote in his essay \"Brahms the Progressive\" that, in his opinion, Brahms's motivic work paved the way for the dissolution of tonality.\n\nThis detailed motivic work is one of Johannes Brahms' stylistic devices. Right from the first movement of the Fourth Symphony, with its descending thirds, different motifs appear repeatedly. The second movement, the Andante, is dominated by dark wind sounds and delicate violin tones. Brahms is said to have viewed the future of classical music rather bleakly in light of the social upheavals of the mid-19th century. This contrasts sharply with the third movement and its playfull Allegro, where dance-like, lively melodies set the tempo. \n\nBrahms wrote to a friend about his Fourth Symphony, saying that he had written \"a collection of polkas and waltzes.\" In the fourth movement, the composer then returns to the form of the Baroque passacaglia with 30 variations. He was probably inspired by both Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor.\n\nBrahms had intended Hans von Bülow to conduct the premiere. But then, much to Bülow's chagrin, he conducted it himself. The payback came when Bülow went on a world tour with Brahms' Fourth Symphony and captivated audiences around the globe. Although Brahms lived until 1897, he didn't write any other symphonies. Similarly, his friend Robert Schumann also composed only four symphonies in his lifetime.\n\nThe London Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1904 and is the oldest symphony orchestra in London. Since 1982, it's been based at the Barbican Centre. This recording was done there in 2022 and features conductor Nathalie Stutzmann. \n\nNathalie Stutzmann is currently the music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. The French singer and conductor conducts orchestras in Europe and Japan, as well as operas. At the Bayreuth Festival, she conducted Richard Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\" and was only the second woman ever — after Ukrainian conductor Oksana Lyniv — to conduct there since the festival was founded in 1876.\n\n© 2022 C Major Entertainment\n\nWatch more great concerts: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nFind the best of Brahms here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBU5_GAu2NLbH0fBf6CEX8kQ\n\nand check out more symphonies: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBXvpOWNmQ1AUBPQeyNanpxY\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: https://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#symphony #brahms #romanticmusic",
