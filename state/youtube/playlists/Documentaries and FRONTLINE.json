With no federal laws on the amount of interest or fees that can be charged, credit cards have become the most profitable sector of the American banking industry.\u201D] In \u201CSecret History of the Credit Card,\u201D correspondent Lowell Bergman uncovers the techniques used by the industry to earn record profits and get consumers to take on more debt. Some experts argue the profitability of credit cards began when the banking industry successfully eliminated a critical restriction: the limit on the interest rate a lender can charge a borrower. Deregulation, coupled with a revolution in technology enabled the almost real-time tracking of personal financial information and the emergence of nationwide banking, facilitated the widening availability of credit cards across the economic spectrum. But for some, the cost of credit is often far greater than it appears.\n\nLove FRONTLINE?

FRONTLINE and the Financial Times investigate how Insys Therapeutics profited from a fentanyl-based painkiller up to 100 times stronger than morphine \u2014 and how some Wall Street investors looked the other way.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Tactics included targeting high-prescribing doctors and nurse practitioners known as \u201Cwhales,\u201D misleading insurers, and holding contests for the sales team: the higher the prescription doses they got doctors to write, the larger the cash prize \u2014 despite the dangers to patients. But as the documentary traces in unprecedented detail, the scheme fell apart: With federal prosecutors using anti-racketeering laws designed to fight organized crime, Insys became the first pharmaceutical company to have its CEO sentenced to prison time in federal court in connection with the opioid crisis.\n\n#Opioids #OpioidCrisis #WallStreet\n\nLove FRONTLINE?

    "Title": "Why China\u0027s manufacturing economy is dominating \u2014 Arthur Kroeber",
    "Description": "Arthur Kroeber is a leading researcher on Chinese tech and macro, a founding partner at Gavekal Dragonomics, and author of \u0022China\u0027s Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know\u0022. It\u0027s the most useful, detailed resource I\u0027ve found of how China actually works. On this episode, we discuss how China achieved high-tech manufacturing dominance, and where they\u0027ll go from here. By Arthur\u2019s account, the Chinese government is like a giant VC fund: they decide on key priorities and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing ruthless competition at the local level. They are willing to lose huge amounts of money for a few of their bets to pay off: at China\u2019s scale, effectiveness matters more than efficiency. There\u0027s also a growing bipartisan consensus that we need to combat China\u0027s rise. This doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. China is a big, powerful country at the frontier in many fields, and its economy is intricately tied in with our own. Being instinctively adversarial is both unsustainable and risky. Arthur and I discuss how we can create a productive, mutually beneficial version of this relationship.\n\n\uD835\uDC04\uD835\uDC0F\uD835\uDC08\uD835\uDC12\uD835\uDC0E\uD835\uDC03\uD835\uDC04 \uD835\uDC0B\uD835\uDC08\uD835\uDC0D\uD835\uDC0A\uD835\uDC12\n* Transcript: https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/arthur-kroeber\n* Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dwarkesh-podcast/id1516093381?i=1000713627073\n* Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EXad7ZEt0oXezigqd7WLe?si=45d9402e6fce4095\n* Get Arthur\u0027s book: https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Economy-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0190239034\n\n\uD835\uDC12\uD835\uDC0F\uD835\uDC0E\uD835\uDC0D\uD835\uDC12\uD835\uDC0E\uD835\uDC11\uD835\uDC12\n* Scale is building the infrastructure for smarter, safer AI.
