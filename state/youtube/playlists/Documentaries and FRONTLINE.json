It\u0027s the most useful, detailed resource I\u0027ve found of how China actually works. On this episode, we discuss how China achieved high-tech manufacturing dominance, and where they\u0027ll go from here. By Arthur\u2019s account, the Chinese government is like a giant VC fund: they decide on key priorities and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing ruthless competition at the local level. They are willing to lose huge amounts of money for a few of their bets to pay off: at China\u2019s scale, effectiveness matters more than efficiency. There\u0027s also a growing bipartisan consensus that we need to combat China\u0027s rise. This doesn\u2019t make much sense to me. China is a big, powerful country at the frontier in many fields, and its economy is intricately tied in with our own. Being instinctively adversarial is both unsustainable and risky.

The consequences: billions of Euros in penalties and the decline of a German institution.\n\nThe Deutsche Bank, once the flagship of the German economy, had fallen from grace. In the 2000s, the bank was pumped full of risk in the quest for ever greater profits. In their bid to make the institution a global player, Deutsche Bank managers gave their investment bankers a free hand - a move that would end up being a major contributing factor in the financial crisis of 2007/2008. Supervisory authorities are still imposing fines to this day, penalties that now run into the tens of billions.\n\nThe victims in all of this are Deutsche Bank customers and shareholders. The share price is hovering around 10 Euros. Twenty years ago, it was around 60 Euros. The documentary shows: The only ones to walk away from this with a good deal were the investment bankers. Many received millions in bonuses year after year, as their greed increased and they paid no heed to the rules and regulations.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #finance \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Adolf Hitler\u2019s right-hand man, Hermann G\u00F6ring, Germany\u2019s foreign minister during the Nazi regime, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Armaments Minister and chief architect Albert Speer, anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher and high-ranking SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner were among those in the dock. The court met for the first time in Nuremberg in November 1945 and was in session for 218 days.\nBy making the Nazi elite answer for their crimes in this hugely complex trial, the Allies ushered in the era of modern international law. Using photos and archive film material, the documentary reconstructs what went on in the court room, as well as revealing what went on behind the scenes. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #nurembergtrials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Description": "Throughout its 250-year existence, the United States has almost always been at war. From its beginnings right through to the present day, the country\u0027s armed forces have shaped both American identity and the political decisions of its leaders.\n\nThe United States of America has been at war throughout most of its 250-year existence. From the War of Independence right through to contemporary armed conflicts, the nation\u0027s armed forces have not only shaped American identity but also influenced the political decisions of its leaders.\nThe documentary takes a deep dive into this complex history and analyzes the \u0022hot\u0022 and \u0022cold\u0022 wars that have shaped US history in order to draw important lessons for the future.\n\nThe film explores how successive generations of US Americans viewed and experienced each conflict. It also examines the enduring impact of these wars on American society and reveals how military engagement was utilized to hone the image and the role of the US on the global stage.\nAround 30 high-profile experts, military personnel and politicians examine the military history of the United States, explaining its successes and failures, as well as its impact on the world and the everyday lives of Americans.\n\nThe film looks to the past to gain a keener understanding of how today\u0027s military decisions will affect tomorrow\u0027s world \u2014 as well as their far-reaching impact on democracy and society. And with US President Donald Trump now in office for a second term, it asks what role the army plays in Trump\u0027s world view.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #usa #war \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Description": "Deutsche Bank managers driven by greed set it on the wrong track in the 2000s. For many years, the financial institution maintained close ties with Vladimir Putin. And involved itself in shady deals with the Russian autocrat.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Deutsche Bank wanted to make it big in Moscow. For some employees, this was something to be achieved by any means necessary: bribing Putin\u2019s officials, brothel visits for good customers, money laundering for the mafia.\n\nWhen it all came to light, this sent a shock wave through the bank: to this day, Deutsche Bank is still laboring under the burden of fines totaling billions. But the CEOs claimed total innocence. Just one of many scandals.\n\nOther questionable deals include loans to Donald Trump. The bank\u2019s very special relationship with the US-American real estate tycoon began in the year 1998. Trump was one of Deutsche Bank\u2019s best customers until shortly before his 2017 presidency. The credit institute loaned him huge sums - despite his track record for business bankruptcy and a dubious reputation as a defaulting debtor.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #deutschebank \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Description": "The Ukrainian intelligence service has intercepted thousands of Russian soldiers\u0027 telephone conversations. They are harrowing testimonies to the cruelty of war. In this film, the calls are juxtaposed against images of the destruction of Ukraine.\n\nOksana Karpovych\u0027s documentary sets images of the war in Ukraine against audio of Russian soldiers phoning their families from the front line. It links the destruction of the nation with those responsible for it, thus highlighting the tragedy of war. But the documentary also shows Ukrainians trying to live relatively normal lives despite the attack on their country.\n\nTension can be heard in the voices of the Russian soldiers. Their accounts reflect the phases they have gone through during their deployment, from a sense of supposed heroism in response to propaganda, to doubt and subsequent disillusionment. Sometimes the fighters lose their heads, committing looting and other crimes. These diverse recordings reveal the full extent of Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nThe award-winning and acclaimed film is a powerful document about the dehumanizing power of war. The juxtaposition of images of the war with the intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers and their relatives amounts to a profound reflection on the banality of evil.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine #russiaukrainewar \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "India at a crossroads - 100 years of the\u202FHindu nationalist RSS movement | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "India\u2019s identity is shifting, with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh reshaping the nation. As the Hindu nationalist RSS movement marks its centenary, DW explores how it\u2019s become one of India\u2019s most influential and controversial organizations.\n\nIndia is at a crossroads. Gandhi\u2019s vision of secularism, once central to the republic\u2019s identity, is increasingly challenged by religion-based nationalism. At the heart of this shift is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) \u2014 a large network with millions of followers. The RSS presents itself as the guardian of Hindu values, while critics widely classify it as a paramilitary organization. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has deep roots in the RSS, its influence reaches to the highest levels of political power. \n \nThe documentary follows families, activists, and eyewitnesses who have been profoundly influenced by the RSS across generations, as well as those negatively impacted by its ideology. It reveals how the RSS, through discipline, rituals, and targeted youth training, is moulding a new generation for whom \u0022Hindutva\u0022 \u2014 the idea of a Hindu nation \u2014 is becoming a lived reality. At the same time, religious minorities and interfaith couples face increasing social pressures and uncertainty.  \n\nFounded in 1925 by K. B. Hedgewar, the early ideological figures of the RSS \u2014 most notably M. S. Golwalkar \u2014 engaged with European nationalist thinking at a time when fascist regimes were gaining ground. While they did not adopt these ideologies wholesale, aspects of the organizational models employed by Mussolini and Hitler appear to have informed the movement\u2019s structure and strategies. \n\nAs the RSS marks its 100th anniversary, its enduring and growing influence raises pressing questions: What remains of Gandhi\u2019s vision for a pluralistic India? Where is the country heading?  And who does India belong to?\n\nThrough historical insight, personal narratives, and exclusive interviews, the film traces a nation at a crossroads \u2014 between tradition and modernity, inclusion and exclusion. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india #rss \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "Syria - The rise and fall of the Assad regime | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "On 8 December 8 2024, Syria\u0027s dictator Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. The film, which was shot before and after the fall of the regime, shows why the dictatorship collapsed so quickly and what hopes Syrians have today.\n\nBashar al-Assad came to power in 2000, after the death of his father. Together with his western-influenced wife Asma, the couple seemed to embody a new beginning for the country. But reforms failed to materialize and when the population took to the streets during the Arab Spring, Bashar al-Assad quickly abandoned his progressive rhetoric. Peaceful demonstrations were met with bloody repression and poison gas attacks. Over 500,000 people were killed, more than 100,000 disappeared and at least six million Syrians were forced into exile.\n\nAmong them was the activist Bassam Ezzedine. In 2013, he documented the regime\u0027s poison gas attack on the Ghouta region. As a result, he had to flee with his family. His sister and her family remained in Syria and were cruelly punished. She was arrested and her children were taken away from her. \n\nAt the time of the first interview, Bassam, like the rest of the world, cannot know that the regime will soon fall and he will be able to return home. As the filming progresses, change comes at a fast pace.\n\nThe war waged by Bashar al-Assad against his own people has destroyed the country\u2019s economic infrastructure. A few weeks before the fall of the regime, Syrian journalist Faysal risked his life to secretly film images of everyday life in Syria: starving children searching for food in the garbage, and endless queues outside bakeries. The country had been bled dry after 54 years of Assad rule. After months of preparation, the Syrian rebels launched a new offensive on 27 November 2024. Within 11 days, they ended the dictatorship - without encountering any serious resistance.\n\nThe new government promised an inclusive administration for all. But as Marie Forestier, Syria expert at the European Institute for Peace, explains: \u0022The real challenge for the new president is to broaden his base. Because so far he has relied exclusively on loyalists from Idlib, who are very conservative.\u0022 And even after the overwhelming victory, the new government does not control the entire territory: in the south, the Israeli army has extended its occupation to the Golan Heights, while in the north, the Turks are bombing Kurdish-controlled areas on a massive scale.\n\nSyria is still unstable. However, the hopes and expectations of Syrians following more than 50 years of Assad rule are high.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #assadregime\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "Exploiting Africa - How China and Europe hunt for the raw materials of the future | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "The global race for the African continent\u2018s coveted raw materials is unscrupulous. The raw material interests of rich nations often trump the rights and needs of the local populations.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, people are being exploited in mines. Chinese traders are illegally buying cobalt, a material Europe needs for its green energy transition. Therefore, Europe buys the cobalt from these illegal traders. The EU now wants to free itself from its dependence on China for raw materials and expand its own local activities. They promise to act more fairly than China - though some say this is not a reasonable promise.\nA huge hydrogen project involving Germany is being planned on the south-east coast of Namibia. The local population is also supposed to benefit from it. However, parts of a national park will be destroyed by the billions being spent in the name of green investment. \u0022Why doesn\u0027t Germany sacrifice its own protected parks for green hydrogen?\u201D asks Namibia\u0027s well-known environmental activist Chris Brown. \nIn the oil-contaminated mangrove forests of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, it becomes clear that Europe is not as climate-friendly as it likes to claim. After all, since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, numerous European investors have been attempting to discreetly arrange lucrative natural gas deals in the country. Congolese activist Patricia Kashala also complains that Europe gives the impression of acting in an exemplary manner, but in practice often puts its own interests in raw materials above the rights of the local population.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #africa #europe #china \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\n\nYemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. \n\nA proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.\n\nFollowing Hamas\u0027s terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes.

    "Title": "The Stasi and the Berlin Wall | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "For one group, at least, the erection of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961 was a stroke of luck. Over the following decades, the Wall would be the lifeblood of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi. By the time the Wall fell, in 1989, thousands of Stasi agents were employed with a single goal: to make the Wall insurmountable.\n\nThe film tells the story of this existentially symbiotic relationship from the perspective of the Stasi under its notorious leader Erich Mielke. It\u2019s the first time this most sensitive chapter of East Germany\u0027s history has been told in such an exemplary and coherent way: including the deaths that took place at the Wall, and the cover-up and concealment of many of those murders.\n\nWe learn about the arrests and imprisonment of tens of thousands of refugees, as well as the Stasi\u2019s elaborate construction of tunnels and underground listening stations to track down tunnel diggers. From the billion-dollar business of selling GDR prisoners to West Germany, to the \u0022filtering\u0022 of Western traffic at border crossings to recruit unofficial collaborators, Mielke\u0027s specialists were everywhere. \n\nWe see how Mielke\u0027s power grew, as the Wall and the border system were perfected, and how the walling-in of the population created more and more work for the Stasi. The Wall became the Stasi\u2019s main field of activity, and its daily bread.\n\nThe fall of the Wall brought an abrupt end to both East Germany and its security apparatus. An irony of history is that, on November 9, 1989, it was a Stasi man who opened the first barrier on Bornholmer Strasse and thus initiated the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n#dwdocumentary #berlinwall #documentary\n\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "NATO - The largest military alliance in the world | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "Since 1949, NATO has shaped Europe\u2018s security policy like no other organization. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty outlines the principle of \u0022collective defense\u201D. But is the world\u0027s largest military alliance ready to defend itself?\n\nMarking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this documentary looks at the past, present and future of NATO. Among other things, it sheds light on vulnerabilities. For example, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is anything but binding. Unanimity among the member states is a prerequisite -- but by no means a certainty. And there are only partial guarantees in place when it comes to the speed with which troops and supplies must be delivered in extreme situations.\n\nThe film embarks on a journey across the Alliance\u0027s territory. The filmmakers visit Tallinn, in Estonia, where NATO\u0027s Cyber Defence Centre is located. From here they travel on to Ulm, in Germany, where the deployment of troops and supplies is organized. The next stop is NATO headquarters in Brussels, where political decisions are made. The film hears from high-ranking current and former NATO generals and security experts along the way.\n\nWith the help of international historians, the documentary also looks back on the 75-year history of NATO. Founded after the devastating experiences of the Second World War, the alliance\u2019s architects wanted to deter enemies. But even more importantly, they wanted to secure peace among the alliance partners - not least out of fears of Germany regaining strength. \n\nThe documentary draws on previously unseen archival film material: NATO portraits of member countries filmed in the 1950s to give soldiers a better understanding of one another\u2019s countries and thus enhance cohesion.\n\nImportant eyewitnesses, including Donald Trump\u0027s former National Security Advisor John Bolton and diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, are featured. They provide context for recent NATO developments: How close was the US to leaving NATO in 2018? And what would the consequences have been? Was a promise really made not to expand NATO eastwards after the collapse of the Soviet Union? The film seeks an answer to this question, which continues to shape Russia\u0027s relationship with NATO to this day. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "TikTok, China and the fear of digital propaganda | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "TikTok is the most popular app among young people, with more than 1.6 billion users worldwide today. Streaming videos featuring influencers in particular draw huge numbers of viewers. But TikTok is highly controversial.\n\nNot just because the app has a very opaque content management system and collects a massive amount of its users\u0027 personal data. This, after all, is also the case with many other social media and apps.\n\nHowever, TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, Byte Dance. This is why the governments of Europe and the US in particular suspect that all the data collected could be passed on to the Chinese regime. They, in turn, could use it to influence public opinion worldwide.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #tiktok #china \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "Farewell to pacifism: Japan is rearming | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "In 1945, under US occupation, the Japanese constitution was created. Toshiko Tanaka, then six years old, had survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. She hoped that this \u0022peace constitution\u201D would prevent wars in the future. But now, Japan is arming itself again.\n\nAfter 1945, Japan was the only country in the world to commit itself to renouncing war in its constitution. But in the face of increasing dangers, the island nation has now announced a rearmament program. By the end of this decade, Japan could become the third strongest military power in the world. The pacifism born of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has given way to fear of aggressive neighbors like China, Russia and North Korea.\n\nUnder conservative governments and in view of the increasing withdrawal of the once-protective USA, the Japanese armed forces have acquired weapons systems. These include amphibious vehicles, US F-35 fighter jets and two aircraft carriers. There is enough plutonium from civilian use in the country to produce up to a thousand nuclear warheads. Missile systems are also available.\nAsia is the key to the future. This documentary shows a new side of Japan and provides insight into the military changes that are taking place there - far from the war in Ukraine. Toshiko Tanaka, one of the last hibakusha, as the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings are called, fears war once more. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #japan \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
