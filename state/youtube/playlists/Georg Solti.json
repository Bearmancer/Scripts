    "Title": "(digital restoration) Beethoven Piano Concerto No.1 - Perahia/Solti, London 1987",
    "Description": "I only listened to Perahia for his Mozart repertoire until i recently found out that he turned out to be a Beethoven-genius also. This piece in particular is one of Beethoven\u0027s initial attempts in the genre and has a lot of Mozart elements to it, making it pretty much suitable for Perahia as the number one Mozartean in my book alongside Andras Schiff (though i saw Schiff played Beethovens but weren\u0027t as impressive).\nUnder the baton of Sir Georg Solti, one the most sought-after conductor at the time, Perahia ft. LSO delivered what i recognize as the best rendition of the piece ever performed on stage. Oh and did i mention the solid 5 minutes-long 1st mvt cadenza?\n\nWork title: Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major, Op. 15\nConductor: Sir Georg Solti\nSoloist (Piano): Murray Perahia\nOrchestra: London Symphony Orchestra\nVenue: Barbican Centre, London, England\nRecord Date: March 1987\nRestoration Date: Jun 2023\n\n(00:00) I. Allegro con brio \n(12:46) cadenza\n(17:49) II. Largo\n(29:16) III. Rondo - Allegro Scherzando\n(35:35) cadenza\n\n--\nAuthor\u0027s note:\nThis content is managed through Youtube\u0027s Standard License Check and is purely intended to be under \u0022fair use\u0022 policy of non-profit educational purposes (section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976).\nDistributing this channel\u0027s content for commercial reason is prohibited.\nContact me at hkdenafel@gmail.com.",

    "Description": "This is probably the closest we\u0027ve ever get to hear and see the perfect Fifth that is very reminiscent of Carlos Kleiber\u0027s century\u0027s recording 15 years prior. \nSir Georg Solti is known to have researched the metronome setting in Beethoven\u0027s days and this is what we get to see as the result.\nCSO have had their many different leadership over the years but in my opinion Solti\u0027s era was their all-time-highest. During which also that the orchestra had played outside of North America in its 80-year history.\n\nWork title: Beethoven - Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67\nConductor: Sir Georg Solti\nOrchestra: Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO)\nVenue: Suntory Hall, Tokyo, Japan\nRecord Date: 15 Apr 1990\nRestoration Date: 12 June 2023\n\n(00:00) I.

    "Description": "In 1982 Cecile Licad at age twenty had her first engagement with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Sir Georg Solti -   which was broadcasted live on public television. At the beginning of this video, Sir Georg Solti was expressing his high esteem towards Cecile\u0027s great talent, knowing of her prodigious background as a young concert artist. It contained a short clip of their rehearsing the Tchaikowky Piano Concerto no.1 in B-flat minor, Op. 23 without the orchestra.  The outstanding cellist, Frank Miller, played the solo cello part of the second movement at this live performance.\n\nIt is note taking that many if not majority of great artists began their training with total dedication when they were very young, growing to develop a real discipline and love of music at a very  early age.  Their prodigious character is a product of hard work and study, love and dedication. This almost became their destiny that  propelled their professional life as with Cecile Licad,  who in 1981 was awarded the prestigious Leventritt Gold medal  into becoming a major concert artist of our days.  She joined the exclusive list of awardees through the years which included Van Cliburn, Gary Graffman,  Ityzak Perlman, and  Alexis Weissenberg, among others.",

Sitting next to the legendary Chicago Symphony Orchestra brass section I realised that nothing had prepared me for the huge, organic sound they made. I don\u0027t think any modern orchestra can or maybe chooses to make this sound now. Much of it is down to principal trumpet Herseth but I also remember the quality of the low end players providing the support for his fearless playing.

Time and the need for a translation has changed that to tubas, just so you know (doubting Thomas\u0027s please look in the score).\r\nThis is here to lament the passing of a style of playing that is so rare to encounter these days - sheer uninhibited passionate unbridled and raw playing which has today been replaced by something more sterile and exact. I will blame conductors any day for wanting everything to sound the way a modern recording does. This is from the DECCA DVD \u0022The Golden Ring\u0022 which is a Humphrey Burton documentary made during the recording of G\u00F6tterd\u00E4mmerung for the Solti Ring Cycle. Buy it from Amazon as well as the CDs with the definitive Siegfriedruf played by Roland Berger aged 21.",

Stokowski\u2019s commercial recording (from various takes jn sessions spread across 1929 and 1930) and Ormandy\u2019s (from mono sessions in April and May of 1955) attest to the difficulty the players had in this repertoire, and EO\u2019s own difficulties with its frequently shifting time signatures are recounted in the interviews I separately posted. Muti\u2019s commercial recording by contrast only required two days in October of 1978. Here, Georg Solti guest conducts, one of two guest gigs he had with Philadelphia in the 1960s.",
