Philadelphia has never commercially recorded any Elliott Carter, and this performance reveals the work as a perfect vehicle to show off both the players’ virtuosity, EO’s commitment to balance and proportion, and the players’ sharing in that commitment. Carter was present for this performance and for the open rehearsals that preceded it.  The work wasn’t shelved after this performance; 4 years later Skrowaczewski, during one of his many Philly guest conducting gigs, programmed the Carter Variations for a February 1966 Carnegie Hall performance.",

Badings was prolific and has an interesting biography (putting aside the Nazi collaboration accusations, which must have been either disproven or unknown to Ormandy). The Badings concerto is thrilling, and I imagine Brusilow and Madison, who got along well according to Brusilow's Shoot the Conductor, had a great time playing it together.",

This movement as a whole has perhaps more the character of a sonata than concerto form.\nThe second movement—andante sostenuto—is introduced by an extended oboe solo. The violin enters with a contrasting and rhapsodic theme, after which it repeats the oboe melody of the beginning.\nThe last movement, a perpetuum mobile, exploits the more brilliant and virtuosic character of the violin.\"",

    "Title": "Beethoven Cto 5 Cliburn Philadelphia Ormandy Dec 1961 Live",
    "Description": "Radio (WFLN) broadcast of Philadelphia Orchestra playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (the \"Emperor\") with soloist Van Cliburn, live in a subscription concert for the 1961-62 season.  Eugene Ormandy conducts.  Ormandy and Philadelphia did not commercially record the Emperor in stereo.  There are two mono performances (1950 with Serkin and 1958 with Istomin), the latter of which was reportedly recorded in stereo but never issued that way.  (Columbia gave Serkin in stereo to Bernstein.) Van Cliburn was an RCA artist and so did not make any commercial recordings with Philadelphia until it jumped back to RCA in late 1968, but the only Beethoven they recorded together was a dreary, flatfooted performance of the Third concerto in 1971 that found both in poor form. (I found the subscription performance recording of that concerto, and it is equally limp and disappointing.) This performance, by contrast, displays the best of what Cliburn had to offer: power, precisely articulated fingerwork (those trills!), a full palette of touch, fluidity, and poise. He does make a few mistakes towards the end of mvt. i and in the middle of iii. Ormandy and Philadelphia supply taut and percussive yet cantabile accompaniment, with interesting phrasing and woodwinds gorgeously balanced forward at times. A few horn glitches in i are the only demerits in the accompaniment. This is a very good performance, and with some retakes would have been an excellent commercial release. Program notes are spoken by William Smith, the orchestra‘s longtime assistant conductor.",

The beginning of the third movement finds his 80-year-old fingers simply uncooperative. Since Rubinstein was an RCA artist, it was not until 1968 that he and Philadelphia started to record together in stereo, when his powers were in decline (more noticeable in the 1971 Rach 2 and Brahms 2 than in the 1968 Chopin 2, 1969 Saint-Saens 2 or 1971 Falla/Gardens). Still, this live performance is on the whole superior to his 1966 commercial stereo recording of the Brahms 1 with Boston under Leinsdorf, and the sound here, while suffering from tape reel rotation artifact that causes annoying left channel flutter for extended periods, is far better than RCA gave him in Boston or in his best commercial recording of this work, the 1954 with Reiner in Chicago.",

The Brahms Bb is in far better sound here than in the commercially released 1960 Ormandy/EO studio performance with Serkin that preceded it or the 1965 Ormandy/PO studio performance with Istomin that followed it (both on Columbia).  Cliburn makes some mistakes from the very beginning, but in general is in better and shapelier form than in his rubato-draggy 1972 live performance with Kondrashin and the Moscow Philharmonic at the Moscow Conservatory (released by RCA).  Lorne Munroe performs the cello solo in mvt. iii here (as opposed to Elsa Hilger in 1960, whose playing Serkin adored so EO wisely went with that, or Sammy Mayes in 1965 after Munroe had left for New York having been poached by Bernstein).  Since the Brahms Cto 2 was a favorite of EO's (5 commercial recordings, 2 in mono and 3 in stereo) the orchestra knows the accompaniment backward and forward and it's just perfect.  With some retakes (for Cliburn, not the orchestra), this would have been a reference recording for sure, but alas Cliburn was an RCA artist, not Columbia.",

They don’t seem to break a sweat and remain tightly disciplined and in perfect proportion, particularly when the notes are coming fast and furious. Let’s also give credit to Mr. Borkow and Mr. Sacks for the marvelous sound picture they created. Yardumian, championed by Ormandy at least in part due to Pitcairn money, is heard here in a world premiere with Lili Chookasian, a contralto Ormandy favored in commercial recordings.

I left in the Delius, although it was commercially recorded for Columbia in 1960 and 1962 (along with Brigg Fair and, in 1961, Dance Rhapsody No. 2) and has been remastered in wonderful sound in the first Columbia Stereo Box; before that, it was available in very good sound from Sony Japan (SICC2134) paired with Elgar, Walton, and Vaughan Williams works (a real banger of a CD).  The gem here is the Barber with Carol, which is very, very special, both because it was the piece that Carol played as his solo premiere in Philadelphia in 1966 after being appointed concertmaster, and because Philadelphia under Ormandy gave the work its world premiere (with Albert Spalding, on the very same violin that ultimately was purchased by Carol) in 1941. (The partial chain of title for that Guarnerius was Spalding, Felix Slatkin, then Carol.)  Carol reported that he had a special feeling for this concerto, and it shows. Philadelphia has never commercially recorded the Barber Violin Concerto.",

Bill Smith's expression of hope that Eppert heard the performance over the radio indicates that this work, composed in 1940, was played as a \"get well\" message to the ill composer, who would die just 8 months later following a long illness that began in 1947.  Ormandy and Eppert were obviously well acquainted; EO and John Barbirolli (then leading the NYPO) were on the jury for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's golden jubilee composition contest in 1941, for which Eppert won with his Symphonic Suite (aka Two Symphonic Impressions), a work originally intended as a ballet depicting a battle between preventive medicine and disease.  Ormandy and Philadelphia had also premiered Eppert's final symphony, titled The Image of America, in 1947.  This Concerto Grosso is a nice enough work, in whose first movement I hear echoes of the first movement of Ives' Symphony No. 1.  The Haydn is a pleasant vehicle to hear Lorne Munroe's artistry.",

Noto per la sua lunga e fruttuosa collaborazione con la Philadelphia Orchestra, Ormandy ha lasciato un'impronta indelebile nel mondo della musica sinfonica.\n\nLa Wiener Philharmoniker, fondata nel 1842, è una delle orchestre più prestigiose al mondo. Con sede a Vienna, ha una lunga tradizione di esecuzioni di altissimo livello e ha collaborato con i più grandi direttori d'orchestra di tutti i tempi.\n\nL'incontro tra Ormandy e la Wiener Philharmoniker è stato un evento particolarmente significativo. Sebbene la maggior parte della carriera di Ormandy sia legata alla Philadelphia Orchestra, il direttore ungherese ha avuto l'opportunità di dirigere anche la Wiener Philharmoniker in diverse occasioni.\n\nQueste collaborazioni hanno dato vita a registrazioni e concerti memorabili, che hanno dimostrato l'affinità artistica tra Ormandy e l'orchestra viennese. La sonorità ricca e opulenta della Wiener Philharmoniker si è sposata perfettamente con lo stile di direzione di Ormandy, creando un sound inconfondibile.\n\nDue capolavori a confronto: Beethoven e Mozart\n\nLa Sinfonia n. 8 in Fa maggiore, Op. 93 di Beethoven e il Concerto per pianoforte n. 21 in Do maggiore, KV 467 di Mozart rappresentano due vertici del repertorio classico, seppur appartenenti a stili e periodi diversi.\n\nLa Sinfonia di Beethoven è un'opera di grande ingegno e vitalità, caratterizzata da una scrittura orchestrale brillante e da una struttura formale rigorosa. Nonostante la sua apparente leggerezza, l'opera cela una profondità espressiva sorprendente, rivelando l'evoluzione stilistica del compositore verso un linguaggio più intimo e personale.\n\nIl Concerto per pianoforte di Mozart è un gioiello di grazia e virtuosismo. Il dialogo tra il pianoforte solista e l'orchestra è affascinante, e le melodie sono memorabili. Mozart, con la sua maestria compositiva, crea un equilibrio perfetto tra virtuosismo e lirismo.\n\nA cosa prestare attenzione ascoltando queste opere:\n\nBeethoven: La ricchezza timbrica dell'orchestra, lo sviluppo tematico e le sorprese armoniche.\nMozart: L'eleganza delle melodie, l'equilibrio tra virtuosismo e lirismo, e la brillantezza dell'orchestrazione.\nEntrambe le opere offrono un'esperienza musicale intensa e coinvolgente, rivelando il genio creativo di due dei più grandi compositori di tutti i tempi.\n\n***\n\nEugene Ormandy, a Hungarian-born American conductor, is a prominent figure in the history of classical music. Renowned for his long and fruitful collaboration with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Ormandy left an indelible mark on the world of symphonic music.\n\nThe Vienna Philharmonic, founded in 1842, is one of the most prestigious orchestras in the world. Based in Vienna, it has a long tradition of performing at the highest level and has collaborated with the greatest conductors of all time.\n\nThe encounter between Ormandy and the Vienna Philharmonic was a particularly significant event. Although most of Ormandy's career is linked to the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Hungarian conductor had the opportunity to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic on several occasions.\n\nThese collaborations have produced memorable recordings and concerts, demonstrating the artistic affinity between Ormandy and the Viennese orchestra. The rich and opulent sound of the Vienna Philharmonic has blended perfectly with Ormandy's conducting style, creating an unmistakable sound.\n\nTwo Masterpieces Compared: Beethoven and Mozart\n\nBeethoven's Symphony No. 8 in F major, Op. 93, and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major, K. 467, represent two pinnacles of the classical repertoire, although they belong to different styles and periods.\n\nBeethoven's Symphony is a work of great ingenuity and vitality, characterized by brilliant orchestral writing and a rigorous formal structure. Despite its apparent lightness, the work conceals a surprising expressive depth, revealing the composer's stylistic evolution towards a more intimate and personal language.\n\nMozart's Piano Concerto is a jewel of grace and virtuosity. The dialogue between the solo piano and the orchestra is fascinating, and the melodies are memorable. Mozart, with his compositional mastery, creates a perfect balance between virtuosity and lyricism.\n\nWhat to listen for when listening to these works:\n\nBeethoven: The rich timbre of the orchestra, the thematic development, and the harmonic surprises.\nMozart: The elegance of the melodies, the balance between virtuosity and lyricism, and the brilliance of the orchestration.",

By age 17 he was a professor of violin, undertaking concert tours throughout Central Europe. Lured to New York City by the prospect of a U.S. tour, he instead ended up playing the violin in the orchestra of the Capitol Theatre, accompanying silent films. In 1924 he stood in for the regular conductor and thereupon chose conducting as his career. He began conducting light classics for radio and appearing at summer concerts, which led to a position as deputy for Arturo Toscanini during a major concert series of the Philadelphia Orchestra. A contract with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra ensued, and he remained there from 1931 to 1936, gaining national prominence with a series of recordings. He returned to the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1936 to share the conductorship with Leopold Stokowski. In 1938 Ormandy was made principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, a post that he held until he retired in 1980. Ormandy shaped the orchestra’s sound by developing the lush, velvety string colour that became its trademark.\"\n\nRemastered By: Wayne Yang, USA-Taiwan",

    "Title": "Foss Improvising Cto Respighi Feste Romane Philadelphia Ormandy Oct 1960 Live",
    "Description": "I left the Respighi in as a chaser, a renowned Philly virtuosity showpiece, particularly in the frenzied last movement. Another excellent example of Ormandy’s ear and the players’ impressive discipline at work, resulting in balances in the fff tutti passages that ensure no instrumental choir is obscured by the others, and with no loss in excitement. \n\nThe Foss work is undeniably well played and the sound is fantastic, putting aside its merit. This was not Ormandy and Philadelphia’s first rodeo with Lukas Foss, or their last. \n\nHere’s what Time Magazine had to say about the Foss work in October of 1960. The article is entitled “Classical Hipsters,” and reveals that after this world premiere the work was taken to Carnegie Hall:\n\nComposers used to like nothing better than to sit down at the harpsichord or pianoforte and improvise on their own works. Bach, Handel and Beethoven were as well known for their improvisations as for their written compositions. Now Composer-Pianist Lukas Foss, 38, is contriving, with the help of a $10,000 Rockefeller grant, to put the long dead custom back into classical music—and make it an ensemble art.\n\nThe idea of “controlled improvisation” to free classical music from its “slavery to the printed note” first occurred to Composer Foss while listening to the high-brow jazz of the Modern Jazz Quartet three years ago. Foss invited a group of classical players—all former composition students of his at U.C.L.A.—to get together and improvise freely in a classical counterpart to the jazz manner. They soon had to give up that approach: “We just daydreamed; we didn’t make music.” What he was looking for, Foss realized, was a group improvisation in which every player would in some way be responsible to the others.\n\nPivotal Notes. Foss began to construct a system built around a series of pre-agreed pivotal notes and a system of letters that indicated what roles the various instruments were to assume at different times. Now he has abandoned the idea of pivotal notes, but the group still starts with “a certain musical vision,” worked out in countless rehearsals and set down in graphs and Foss’s own specially devised symbols. “If we hit something good,” says Foss, “we try to remember it. If something bad, we try to forget it.” The technique, insist the players, is far more complex than that of jazz. “It’s the difference between playing slapjack and playing bridge.”\n\nFoss and his group of composer-performers, known as the Improvisation Chamber Ensemble, appeared at Carnegie Hall last week with the visiting Philadelphia Orchestra to display their technique in somewhat elaborated form. Their scheduled piece, certainly the oddest they have yet attempted, was titled Concerto for Improvising Solo Instruments and Orchestra. Pianist Foss and his men—flute, cello, clarinet and percussion—were ranged downstage in front of the orchestra, and Conductor Eugene Ormandy only rarely cast a nervous backward glance at them.\n\nControlled Chance. The Concerto consisted of three movements, actually written down for the orchestra by different members of the ensemble and “edited” by Foss. The music was rather faceless—tricked out with a full Modern Composer’s Kit of dissonances, rhythmic angularities, splashy climaxes. Against this background, Foss and the ensemble worked out their improvisations. It was in the Intermezzo, when the orchestra was silent, that Foss’s technique of “controlled chance” came into fullest play. The Foss ensemble was free to improvise—and it did, with some highly interesting results. The instruments traded themes, stitched their own sinewy figurations, advanced and retreated from the solo role.\n\nFor the most part the effect was spare and angular—a little like the small-toned, pointillistic compositions of Anton von Webern.\n\nInnovator Foss, who is back teaching at U.C.L.A. after a year’s sabbatical for composition, does not expect his system to replace the written score. He himself has just completed a fully written-out composition, Time Cycle, for Soprano and Orchestra (to texts by Auden, Housman, Kafka and Nietzsche), which will be played for the first time by the New York Philharmonic this week. Between numbers, Foss’s ensemble will do improvised “commentaries” on the songs. With the spread of controlled improvisation, Foss thinks the day may come when a typical concert will begin with bits of Bartok or Beethoven and, in between, feature the members of a chamber group spinning out their own trackless flights of fancy.",

    "Description": "Of his “Commemoration Symphony,” composed between 1964 and 1966 to commemorate his 40th and Ormandy’s 30th anniversary with the orchestra, and here given its somewhat delayed world premiere in an abridged form, Louis Gesensway (who was a violinist in our orchestra from 1926 through his retirement in 1971) wrote:\n\n“The underlying theme is life and death. We come into this world with a cataclysmic force. We are thereby set into motion until we leave abruptly and sometimes violently. The mode of our existence depends entirely on the way we develop through all of our experiences. These are the resuits of a continuous struggle with the forces of nature, the emotions within ourselves, and the conflicts within society. The struggle, however, is not always intense. The mood changes within each movement suggest man’s frequent frustrations and his occasional realization of attainment. The close of the symphony, representing death, comes with a crescendo in the percussion and with a timpani roll which dies away to the end.\n\n“First Movement (Allegro, Molto Agitato) opens with a crash in the percussion and short, rhythmic pulses. It is in the basic sonata form.\n\n“Second Movement (Vivace, Molto Ritmico) is written in a lighter mood, with rapid and unusual rhythmic dance motifs. A feeling of jazz prevails.\n\n“Third Movement (Sostenuto, Andante Lugubrioso) is slow, expressing feelings of tenderness and sadness. Prominent oboe solos occur in the opening and closing sections. The movement ends very quietly with a timpani solo.\n\n“Final Movement (Allegro Giusto) is constructed on three principal themes, playful in spirit, which are developed and then recapitulated with varied orchestrations. The third theme is broken off suddenly; a drum roll and crash slowly die away to the end.”\n\nI encourage you to listen to the interview of Gesensway, which is uploaded separately here at the beginning of the second half of the concert, comprising the Mendelssohn violin concerto played by Norman Carol and (yet another) La Mer. His perspective as both an orchestral player and a composer is fascinating.  He was a prolific composer, and developed a system he called “color harmony“ by expanding and contracting the intervals of the diatonic scale into fractions.\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra and Ormandy were loyal to their own, and this is just one example. They commercially recorded for Columbia Gesensway’s Four Squares of Philadelphia in a 1955 performance, available remastered in the Ormandy mono box.",

The Flanagan Concert Ode, with Flanagan on hand to hear it, is beautiful and bears out his mentoring by Copland. The Gliere is good, but Mason Jones (who gave the work its American premiere in Teaneck, New Jersey) is surpassed here by any number of other soloists in this work. The ends of his phrases compete with his anticipation of taking a breath, he fluffs lots of notes, and he seems more pokerfaced than characterful. La Valse is quite good but bettered by both Columbia commercial recordings (1953’s barnburner in mono — a real jaw-dropper, that one — and 1963 in stereo).",

Gilels, in the midst of his 6th North American tour, gives an exciting performance using the lighter cadenza (as was his wont), a performance that he would reprise 11 days later in Carnegie Hall. That latter performance has been available on Melodiya for years, but as one commenter points out the sound achieved here by Messrs. Borkow and Sacks is far superior, making this recording a welcome discovery. There is some slight warble in the transfer from tape to digital that is the only demerit to the sonics; microphones and piano/orchestra balance are ideal. There are a few mistakes, these start piling up in the breathless finale. The audience goes crazy at the conclusion, stomping their feet demanding an encore (which, if given, was not captured), enthusiasm not typically demonstrated by Academy of Music audiences. The Handel is gorgeously played, too.",

    "Description": "This special gala concert celebrated the 107th anniversary of the Academy of Music, which Bill Smith reminds us was called “the Grand Old Lady of Locust Street.” Solo violinist Young-Uck Kim was just 16 and solo pianist Andre Watts just 18 at the time of this concert. Kim entered Curtis in 1961, was taught by Ivan Galamian (who also taught Veda Reynolds, hired by Ormandy in 1943, the first woman in our violin section) and had his national debut in a televised concert with Philadelphia under Ormandy the previous year, 1963, just one of many examples of solo careers launched from our orchestra during the Ormandy years.  Andre Watts was another example:  he played the Mendelssohn 1 at the Dell at age 9, and debuted in a subscription concert at age 14 in the Franck Symphonic Variations.  Exactly one year before this concert, Watts played the Liszt 1 on national TV with the NY Philharmonic under Bernstein. Both Kim and Watts went on to have successful solo careers, both on stage and in the recording studio.  Kim gives a masterful performance of the Saint-Saens (repeatedly recorded commercially with Francescatti, Stern, and Dylana Jenson), and Watts generates lots of drama and excitement in the Liszt (repeatedly recorded commercially with Arrau, Entremont [my personal favorite], and Cliburn) and at a couple of points tries to outrun Ormandy, which is lots of fun.  The infrequently-heard Kabelevsky is a rousing opening, and I left the warhorse Dukas in, played to a fare-thee-well despite a single horn glitch.",

The bassoon concerto was composed in 1964, and Maestro Garfield shows it off to its best advantage, aided by the orchestra and EO's careful dynamics. I think Bernard Garfield was far more than a principal bassoonist; he was a musical philosopher, as the extracts of his interview with Sharon Eisenhour, posted in this channel, reveal.  The Prokofiev, which received its American premiere in Philadelphia in April of 1953 under Ormandy's baton, was promptly recorded commercially for Columbia in mono in April of 1953.  Philadelphia never returned to the recording studio, with Ormandy or anyone else, to capture the Prokofiev 7 in stereo, though it was programmed with some frequency in these decades, so it is nice to have this spirited stereo performance.",

The Choral Fantasy is just excellent in every single way.  One commenter used the word \"exuberant,\" and he is right on, in my opinion.  Columbia had given the Choral Fantasy with Serkin to Bernstein and the NYPO for a commercial recording, and while I love that version, this one is even better played and sung, certainly more interestingly so.  Serkin sounds great at 66 years of age here.  EO would use amateur choral forces instead of professional, as illustrated in this concert.  Here, it's the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia (now called the Mendelssohn Chorus), which Philly still calls upon for live performances.  Temple University, Rutgers University, and of course for commercial recordings the Mormon Tabernacle were used through the decades, as have local community choirs (Newark Boys' and Philly Boys, to name just two).  I personally love this practice of eschewing professional choirs in favor of local and amateur forces, but others have registered disapproval, particularly when discussing the pronunciation of non-English words (and for the Mormons, even English ones!).",

This performance is better recorded than the 1969 commercial performance issued by RCA (which unlike this performance featured the \"Blumine\" movement).  I had read that Ormandy was very good in the Mahler 1, but you wouldn't know it from that RCA disc. By contrast, this performance demonstrates it clearly.  Ormandy finds all kinds of interesting orchestration to highlight and balance, and apparently did some rescoring, including bells in the finale.  The players are committed, with characterful phrasing and tasteful portamenti in the strings throughout. (The theme of the program was Vienna, so perhaps everybody was Vienna-ing things up.) There's a horn glitch in ii, fatigue becomes evident in the horns and brass in iv, and I think one of the celli may have gone flat in iv. Nevertheless, a superlative performance that suggests to me that rather than debating whether Bernstein/NYPO or Walter/CSO should have been released first in this work (Bernstein reportedly \"gave way\" to Walter after hearing John McClure's master tape), Columbia would have done better to look to Ormandy/PO.  I also now think, on the basis of this performance, that Ormandy had more to say in the Mahler 1 than Muti did in the PO's justly highly regarded 1984 commercial recording on EMI.  Program notes are spoken by William Smith, the orchestra‘s longtime assistant conductor.",

It's a good performance, not great, marred by some broken first movement trumpet notes by Johnson, horn notes by Mason Jones, and even a missed piccolo lick by John Krell. Dodson's relative lack of vulgarity and the Academy of Music's dead acoustic result in first movement trombone solos that may be too polite and not sufficiently primordial for some. As a final demerit, Betty Allen pushes herself too hard in iv, leading to a strained, throaty “Kermit the frog” sound at times.",

Another sublime live performance of the Fourth, which supplies a very interesting comparison against the March 1972 performance available on this channel.  Out of the gate, Ormandy sets a brisk pace, though the total timings of the two performances are not much different, perhaps because there is greater flexibility of tempo throughout this performance.  Perhaps it's the microphone placement, but in the 1972 performance Ormandy seems to devote greater attention to balances, especially noticeable in ii.  Associate conductor Bill Smith's oral program notes, delivered in his trademark deadpan, are interesting as usual.  Camilla Williams' vocal timbre to my ear is just perfect for iv.  Had Columbia decided to commercially record Philly/Ormandy/Williams in this work, I think it would have rivaled Reiner's contemporaneous (and to my ear somewhat cold) RCA release with Lisa Della Casa. But Bernstein was busy recording the Mahler symphonies at this time for Columbia. A listener reports that the recording or its archival transfer is sped up, causing the entire performance and Bill Smith’s voice to be a half step sharp.",

I much prefer this live performance, which is bouncier and faster, with deliciously lighter string tone. Murray Panitz and the flute battery are magnificent in iv. A horn glitch in mvt. i is the only demerit. (The numerous cracked horn notes I have heard thus far in these live performances make me wonder if I should appreciate Montone, Lang, Dwyer, Torres and McFarland a bit more.) Program notes are spoken by William Smith, the orchestra‘s longtime assistant conductor. ￼",

    "Description": "Norman Carol deserves far more acclaim than he receives, and it is nice to hear him play the Mendelssohn so well instead of having to rely on commercial recordings by Spalding, Stern (x2), or Oistrakh (just the second Stern in stereo).  He has a varied range of tone here, from beefy to sweet (but never brittle), his phrasing is always refined, and he is undefeatable in the breakneck final movement, which is thrilling.  I left La Mer in (which can be compared to the January 1964 live version, separately uploaded and paired with Francescatti playing the Saint-Saens Violin Concerto No. 3). This upload begins with Louis Gesensway describing his Commemoration Symphony, also separately uploaded, and both the symphony and Gesensway should be heard.  His perspective as a fiddler turned composer is unique and fascinating.  Guess where he prefers to sit to audition his works?",

The Mozart would the following month be taken into Philadelphia's Town Hall (150 N. Broad St., demolished in 1983) for a commercial recording by Columbia on April 8, 1962.  The Beethoven finds Firkusny confidently speeding along in the first movement, outrunning EO and the orchestra on occasion, causing some minor occasional ensemble issues in the accompaniment.  This is an athletic and energetic performance, breathless at times, with close-up sound that is like an X-ray exposing Firkusny's commanding virtuosity.  The first movement cadenza is thrilling, so the audience can't help applauding between movements.  We have a cougher who mars the quiet second movement largo.  Firkusny's third movement fingerwork is astonishing in its fusion of beauty, precision, and speed.  He tries to outrun the orchestra at times, but they're twice shy and not having it.  A memorable performance; I cannot name a better one of this work.",

    "Description": "The jewel here is the Haffner, since the late Mozart symphonies weren’t commercially recorded in stereo by Philadelphia, Columbia (justly) giving them to Bruno Walter and the so-called Columbia Symphony Orchestra (LA Phil players off the clock playing at the acoustically perfect American Legion Hall in Hollywood fortuitously found by Columbia producer John McClure for Walter’s Indian Summer recordings). This Haffner sounds perfect, suitably aristocratic to match the reason for its composition, and while not “historically informed” it is taut and percussive, defying the “Bach-maninoff” dig Ormandy sometimes receives. Although Webern’s Im Sommerwind is a warhorse commercially recorded by Ormandy and Philadelphia, I included it because our orchestra gave its world premiere in May of 1962, and this is its Philadelphia premiere. In fact, after the score was unearthed (literally) following Webern’s tragic death in 1945 at the hands of American forces in Austria and then lay fallow for two decades in the possession of Webern’s relatives, Im Sommerwind — which Webern had discarded as juvenilia after it was derided by Schoenberg — was given immediately to none other than Ormandy for a first performance by our orchestra. \n\nOrmandy’s correspondent was German-American musicologist and Webern biographer Hans Moldenhauer, who had heard that Webern’s relatives had in their possession a bust of the composer. He visited the family in 1961 and among their holdings found not only the bust but manuscripts, including that of Im Sommerwind. Moldenhauer arranged to have the score published and performed, the premiere taking place in May of 1962 with our orchestra under Ormandy’s baton, in conjunction with the Seattle World’s Fair and the simultaneous First International Webern Festival. It is a work that plays to this orchestra’s unmatched ability to infuse a score with nuanced color.\n\nThe second half of this same concert comprised the American premiere of the Shostakovich 4, uploaded separately in this channel.",

    "Description": "The Music Makers: Angels of Grandeur and Epiphany\n\nThe American Federation of Musicians accomplished a wonderful thing in the 1960’s when they sponsored the Congress of Strings and moved mountains to establish a successful nearly ten year program aimed at promoting string playing in the United States and Canada and intensifying a nationwide interest in live music.\n\nThe photo shows Eugene Ormandy, noted conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, putting the Congress of Strings summer scholarship orchestra through its paces prior to conducting an enthusiastically received public concert Friday evening July 12, 1963 at Michigan State University (attached live recording). The 100-piece unit consists of youthful instrumentalists 15 to 22 years old. They are chosen in competitive auditions throughout the United States and Canada to attend an all-expense eight week summer session under the top first chair symphony teachers of the day, wholly sponsored by the American Federation of Musicians and some 700 affiliated locals. This post originated from the May 2014 sad news of the death of Paul Tobias, principal cellist in the photo. It reminded me of a very special, magical moment in my life and undoubtedly in the lives of many if not most of those one hundred string players that fateful day in the summer of 1963. In addition to Paul Tobias the other ‘cellists in the photo are Virginia Brown (now known as Jennifer Langham), Sally Guenther, and James Kreger. On the outside second stand first violins is Tania Rudensky from St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada. Years later she married Metropolitan Opera baritone Cornell MacNeil. Tania and I played quite a bit of chamber music together that summer, and before the end of our session she gave me a beautifully inscribed book, “The Art of String Quartet Playing,” which I treasure to this day.\n\nThe first rehearsal created an emotional groundswell. With great anticipation we all were looking forward to working with Eugene Ormandy, who for many years, along with Leopold Stokowski, preserved and cultivated the legendary Philadelphia Orchestra string sound. When Ormandy asked to begin with the Barber Adagio, something was about to happen in that large room at Williams Hall, Michigan State University. It would cast an indelible mark on the souls of 100 string players for the rest of our lives. As Maestro Ormandy held up his arms and began to conduct, what an incredible sound filled our space! It was an indescribable, unbelievably massive but hushed, wide sound, pregnant with pathos, enveloping everyone in its grandeur and majesty. It seemed as if we had been lifted out of our skins, transported by pure sound launching us up and out into the soul of the universe. It was as if we were not actually playing at all but riding some omnipotent divine wave. Looking back to the ecstasy of those few moments...which seemed timeless...I now realize we were experiencing what some would later describe as an epiphany.\n\n- James Kreger, Cellist",

It is truly congratulatory (and shares a bit in those congratulations) and the virtuosic playing it requires is exciting. Von Einem's Philadelphia Symphony, which seems to contain some allusions, celebrates the Academy of Music’s 104th anniversary, but was delayed in its performance when Ormandy got into a car accident which laid him up for a while. There are suggestions here and there that Ormandy’s car accident was just a pretext, and that the true reason for its delayed premiere was dissatisfaction with the work.",

(Bill Smith wouldn't have made this mistake, but announcer Neill Curran misidentifies Joe De Pasquale as principal violin instead of viola.)  The work was commissioned by the Kansas City Philharmonic and premiered in 1965, and is probably the most frequently performed work by Benjamin Lees.  After hearing it, I think it should be performed more.  The Piston is exciting as heck and there is another, earlier performance on this channel to compare.  (The 1962 world premiere for the opening of Lincoln Center (the reason for the composition) was in mono, so I skipped it.)  Till is interesting.  It is played for character rather than sonority, and so is more like the 1952 commercial performance than the 1963, which I find values sonority over character.  Mason Jones really paces himself on those horn runs in this live performance, unlike in either commercial performance, and candidly I think Myron Bloom (Cleveland) bests Jones in the commercial recordings.  There is another commercial recording on RCA from 1974 that I've never been able to get my hands on.",

Perhaps that's why both the Gloria and the Chopin (the Philadelphia debut for Ohlsson) are so significantly cut, which is disappointing because they are both so well played and sung.  The Poulenc is missing the Laudemus Te and the first Domine Deus, skipping directly from the Gloria to the Domine Fili Unigenite.  The accompaniment to the Poulenc is played very French, all clipped and nasal, EO and the players finding nice instrumental lines to highlight.  A listener points out below that the Chopin is cut in the first movement exposition.  It was commercially recorded 5 times by Philadelphia under EO, with Sandor, Brailowsky, Gilels, Cliburn, and Ax (the middle three in an 8-year period).  Ohlsson was just 22 at the time of this concert, fresh off his triumph in winning the Chopin competition in Warsaw, and he sounds just fantastic, silky smooth (those runs!) and powerful. Philadelphia recently got to hear Ohlsson in a perfect performance of the Beethoven Emperor, as a last minute substitution for Yefim Bronfman (who was nursing a hand injury) under Tugan Sokhiev's baton in April of 2025.",

Three concerti in one concert performance!  (Janis first performed this feat, in this same repertoire, during his 1962 tour of Russia.) The PO under Ormandy never commercially recorded the Prokofiev Cto 3; plans to do so were abandoned after Ormandy and Tedd Joselson had a falling out.  (A 1947 live performance with Kapell is available on streaming services.) This is an excellent performance, demonstrating Janis's virtuosic precision, Ormandy's skill as an accompanist, and the PO's poised athleticism in Prokofiev.  Janis was an RCA and Mercury artist, and so made no commercial recordings with Philadelphia, even after Philadelphia jumped back from Columbia to RCA in late 1968, but did perform live in subscription concerts relatively frequently (in 1954, 1957, 1960, 1963, 1967, and 1971).

The Scythian Suite was commercially recorded by Philadelphia and Ormandy only in mono (1947), remastered as well as can be expected in the 2021 Ormandy box set. It is good to be able to hear Prokofiev’s gift for storytelling in modern stereo sound. Ormandy’s disciplined maintenance of proportion, careful dynamics, and refusal to allow excessive intensity to distort the music pay dividends here, enhancing rather than sacrificing drama. It cannot be easy on the brass to keep a lid on it, but they nail it. Although I previously uploaded Janis’s earlier Prokofiev Cto 3, the last work in his 3-concerto marathon for that pension fund concert, I did not delete this later singleton performance, which permits comparison. Surprisingly, despite markedly different conditions and slightly different sound pictures (this later performance mikes Janis more closely and may on the whole be finer sound-wise), I think Janis sounds remarkably consistent between performances.",

Eugene Ormandy conducts, with soloist Byron Janis. This concert also included Janis playing Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 (separately posted on this channel). Three concerti in one concert performance!  (Janis first performed this feat, in this same repertoire, during his 1962 tour of Russia.) Janis was an RCA and Mercury artist, and so made no commercial recordings with Philadelphia, even after Philadelphia jumped back to RCA from Columbia in late 1968, but did perform live in subscription concerts relatively frequently (in 1954, 1957, 1960, 1963, 1967, and 1971).  The opening work is the Purcell trumpet voluntary (which wasn’t by Purcell and isn’t a voluntary) played very well by Gil Johnson, so I left it in.  Program notes are spoken by William Smith, the orchestra’s longtime assistant conductor.  The real attraction here is the Prokofiev, not these other warhorses (commercially recorded by PO/Ormandy with Entremont and Serkin (3x!) respectively), but hearing Janis with Philadelphia under Ormandy, instead of with Chicago under Reiner (or Minneapolis or Moscow under Skrowaczewski or Kondrashin), is a real treat.",

But it was in mono, leaving many to pine for a stereo version.  Pine no more:  this is that version.  Istomin, a consummate artistic professional, strikes an ideal balance between articulation and passion, and the orchestral accompaniment is everything you would expect. Since this was an all-Rachmaninoff concert that included the Second symphony, I will include the Vocalese in this video and the symphony in another video, even though they don’t meet the main prerequisite for inclusion that I set for this channel:  difficult/impossible to obtain in a commercial recording.

I find Barenboim’s pianism here even more leaden and labored than in that traversal; perhaps this is just an illusion and Klemp’s own leaden and labored accompaniment somewhat camouflaged this quality in Barenboim’s playing. Philadelphia’s accompaniment here is taut and lithe rather than grazioso, once again belying the trope that Philly’s execution was mindlessly and uniformly legato. The Rochberg is well played but in Rochberg’s view poorly conducted — please read his transcribed interview excerpts posted elsewhere on this channel to hear his unvarnished views of EO. The comments below likewise feature some unvarnished views of Rochberg’s Zodiac.",

Harold Sacks, who assisted Albert Borkow, Jr. in these fantastic airchecks and who was a charter member of the Rozsa Society, comments below on the work’s significance to the career of Bernstein. Then Francescatti returns for two Paganini caprices, IX and XXIV, both of whose accompaniment he arranged for orchestra.

Why he never returned to the studio to record the 4 Schumann symphonies is a mystery to me.

(There is also a traversal by Sawallisch at Marian Anderson Hall, but the in-house sound isn't very good, making Don Liuzzi’s timpani sound uncharacteristically tubby.)  This 1961 performance is as percussive as it is cantabile, and Ormandy’s balances (and “judicious” rescoring, Bill Smith discloses) reveal Schumann’s gorgeous harmonies. Mason Jones's heroic horn call in the recapitulation of i is just slightly less extroverted here than in the 1977 commercial recording for RCA (I assume that's Jones in 1977 and not Nolan Miller). The low brass are both muscular and refined in iv.  It is a mystery why Ormandy did not return to the studio for a Schumann traversal and instead ceded the repertoire to a guest conductor.",

    "Description": "Radio (WFLN) broadcast of Philadelphia Orchestra playing Sibelius Symphony No. 5 live in a subscription concert for the 1960-61 season.  Eugene Ormandy conducts.  I included this because I suspected that this live stereo performance from 1960 would bear more of the characteristics of the 1954 mono commercial recording on Columbia than of the 1975 stereo commercial recording on RCA.  I think my suspicions are borne out.  And let me exercise my privilege as channel operator to add one gratuitous and perhaps unkind comment:  Ormandy is miles ahead of recent Finnish guest conductors Stasevska and even Salonen in achieving suitable balances among the sections of the PO in the loud tutti passages of this work. Considering the clogged sound Stasevska created (Salonen, one of her teachers, created a far better sound), I thought that maybe Ormandy simply had the benefit of a recording studio, but this live performance suggests the real reason: his skill as a conductor. I also have a live performance from Oct of 1963 that sounds less like the 1954 and more like the 1975, but will post it only if people ask.",

    "Description": "Assistant conductor William Smith leads the Philadelphia Orchestra in Sibelius’s short tone poem En Saga, just two weeks before the orchestra and Ormandy would commercially record the work the second time (the first in stereo) for Columbia. Interesting to note that Smith’s timing (19 mins) is two minutes longer than Ormandy’s Columbia stereo version, three minutes longer than Ormandy’s earlier Columbia mono version (1955), and one minute longer than Ormandy’s later RCA stereo version (1975). En Saga sounds just as good live as in the recording studio.  The Tartini Cello Concerto is a vehicle to show off the tone of Lorne Munroe, principal cello who, in a couple of years, would be poached by Bernstein and head to New York.  The second half of this concert will also feature Munroe in Kabalevsky's Cello Concerto No. 1, separately uploaded in this channel.",

The Sessions 5 is a world premiere, commissioned by Ormandy in 1960 and finished when Sessions was 68 years of age.  It was never commercially recorded by Ormandy/Philadelphia. Do not pay any mind to the Wikipedia entry declaring that this performance is only of the first movement and the symphony was not complete until December of 1964.  As Bill Smith explains, all three movements are here, played without pause.",

A challenging breakpoint between halves of this concert prevented me from presenting the Domestica separately, so this is the whole concert in one shot.  It is nice to have Ormandy conducting a stereo version of the Domestica, and in such vivid color. For comparison, there is an excellent version on YouTube from 1993 with Sawallisch conducting at Suntory Hall, back when Jeffrey Khaner still had hair. There are no commercial versions by the PO other than the 1938 mono on Victor. I don't know how Bill Smith both announced the program and played organ in the Praludium, but according to the archival material that's what he did.  (See the comment below in which a professional sound engineer explains those mechanics.) The Praludium is a bonkers fanfare, way over the top, and should be heard more, even if some consider it a trashy monstrosity (which can be a virtue!). Hilde Guden’s voice is just lovely, and powerful.",

Rossen Milanov, another fine associate conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, more recently led the Jongen with well known Philadelphia organ soloist Peter Richard Conte playing the famous Wanamaker Organ in Philadelphia in 2008, a good performance (albeit with lots of hall reverberation and long decay --- Wanamaker's is a giant cavern, after all, and the organ pipes are spread out) available on all streaming services.  Ormandy did not program or commercially record the Metamorphosen until 1978, on an RCA issue I have never been able to get my hands on.",

Magaloff, a serious pedagogue of other virtuosi who was in the midst of a worldwide tour, makes lots of mistakes in trying to deliver the electricity this work calls for, a work he would go on to record commercially twice (once with the Hague and once with the NDR).  The orchestra delivers the high voltage brilliantly.",

Eugene Ormandy conducts first the Tchaikovsky Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture, with his trademark cymbal crash additions. Reviewers of the EO/Philly commercial recordings of this work (1953, 1964, 1973) condemn those added crashes as vulgarities, but I think playing this dignified can accommodate a little trashiness without compromising its high level of musicality, to say nothing of the intense drama the orchestra whips up. The Kabalevsky is an appealing Soviet realist work, affording plenty of opportunities to show off our orchestra’s collective virtuosity. But it’s the Balakirev/Casella that really allows Philly to strut its stuff with this exciting showpiece that Ormandy builds to a bonkers ending climax.  The orchestra would commercially record Islamey a week later (alongside Strauss's Don Quixote and part of the Mozart Horn Concerto No. 4).  I much prefer the sonics that Messrs. Borkow and Sacks achieve here to those that Columbia producer John McClure would achieve a week later in Town Hall a/k/a Scottish Rite Cathedral.",

    "Description": "From this all-Tchaikovsky concert, here is a Romeo and Juliet that begins rather tepidly to my ear but which intensifies at the first climax and stays intense until its conclusion. Excluding early Stokowski from 1928 on Victor, there are five commercial versions of this work, from 1953 (in the first Ormandy mono box), 1964 (in the second Columbia stereo box), 1973 (in the Ormandy Tchaikovsky box issued by Sony of mostly RCA recordings with EO against a purple background), 1988 (Muti on EMI), and 2008 (Eschenbach on Ondine). Nathan Milstein was not quite 60 at the time of this excellent performance of the violin concerto, marred only by some occasional unsteadiness in the horns. He has just two commercial recordings with Philadelphia, in 1944/1945 (the Lalo Symphonie Espagnole, which I believe is the earliest entry in the Ormandy mono box) and a 1951 Brahms concerto for Vn and Vc with Piatagorsky on RCA, with Reiner conducting the pseudonymous Robin Hood Dell orchestra (to circumvent Columbia’s contractual restrictions), but was a relatively frequent live soloist from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, and then twice between 1979 and 1980, playing standard concerto fare: Beethoven, Brahms, Dvorak, and Bruch.",

Some technical glitches in the transfer of this recording to CD are the only issues with this beautiful performance that shows our brass off to its best advantage.  And just listen to that gorgeous phrasing throughout the work.  I prefer this performance to the 1970 RCA one (issued with the sonically disastrous Mahler Resurrection, both works typically being performed over the Easter season).  The most notable gem here is the world premiere of L'horloge de flore (The Flower Clock or Flora's Clock) by Jean Françaix.  The work was commissioned by (and is dedicated to) John De Lancie, principal oboe. It was completed in 1959, was premiered by De Lancie in this performance.  It definitely shows off De Lancie's virtuosity and beautiful tone; whether it's an enduring work is debatable.  Ravel's Alborada del Gracioso, an exciting showpiece played with precision and gusto, had been commercially recorded by Ormandy in 1958 on Columbia (and would be re-recorded by Muti in 1982 on EMI). You can also find on this channel a version conducted by Stokowski in a December 1962 pension fund concert.",

It was written after the posthumously discovered Im Sommerwind (which would not be given its world premiere until two months after this performance), but still is listed as his Op. 1.  The Sibelius Symphony No. 4 performance I find idiosyncratic.  I am used to its bleakness being delivered with playing characterized by intense concentration and tightly controlled attacks, decays, and dynamics.  Stokowski does not exert that control and as a consequence I find this performance episodic and lacking in tension and cohesiveness.  There are great moments, to be sure.",

The upload begins with an interview with Istomin (conducted by George Diehl, who seems incapable of vibing with any interviewee) that is remarkable for Istomin’s detailed expressions of adulation for the Philadelphia Orchestra, with whom he has soloed for 31 years. This is the first time Istomin and Philly have collaborated in the Schumann. The performance can be compared both to his 1959 commercial performance with Walter (Columbia Symphony Orchestra, not sure if it was recorded in NY or LA, but the producer was Columbia’s John McClure) and to his teacher Rudolf Serkin’s commercial performances (3x) with Philadelphia under Ormandy. Serkin’s crystal clear and plainspoken articulation has always appealed to me because it contrasts so pleasantly with the plush accompaniment Philly supplies. Well, Istomin has Serkin’s articulation but also an impetuous streak, both with Walter but moreso with Ormandy here, and with a far better ensemble, making for a heart-on-sleeve performance with swooping gestures coming from both the keyboard and the ensemble. Decadently romantic but never garish.",

This performance is included on this channel because it is very different from the commercial one (also included on this channel in view of its relative unavailability), both in the sound picture and in pacing. This live performance is more expansive than the brisk RCA. Timings help tell the story:\n\n       1968 RCA:     This one:   \nI:       17:29              19:00\nII:      18:46              19:32\nIII:       9:12                9:37\nIV:     10:11               10:40\n\nThis live performance is also better recorded than the commercial version and so better captures the careful balances being imposed by (and on) the players. No one is drowned out by anyone else, even in the tutti fortissimo passages. You hear every instrumental line; you will hear bits of the score you didn’t know were there (particularly evident in the Scherzo). Crescendos are kept in proportion, building with disciplined steadiness to dignified climaxes. Attacks and decays, especially in the horns and brass, maintain perfect ensemble. And the blend in the horns and low brass is remarkable. Such control! Are those two woodwind overblows in the B section of the Scherzo on purpose? And the strings in the Adagio (and the B section of the Scherzo) are just gorgeous. This is a superlative performance in every way; I cannot say enough about it.",

    "Title": "Bruckner 9 Te Deum Philadelphia Ormandy Sept 1974 Live",
    "Description": "Eugene Ormandy conducts Bruckner's Symphony No. 9 with the Te Deum as the 4th movement (something YNS did recently and which Bruckner himself apparently suggested be done).  The tempi here are brisk.  Very brisk.  Like Salonen’s recent guest conducting gig here in Bruckner and Mozart, the tempi here suggest that EO maybe had a plane to catch.  The first half of this concert was a 30-minute-long Bach Cantata, so perhaps EO was trying to shorten this long concert.",

    "Title": "LvB 7 Maw Scenes Philadelphia Ormandy Sept 1974 Live",
    "Description": "Eugene Ormandy conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra in Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 and in the western hemisphere premiere of Nicholas Maw's Scenes and Arias with soloists Benita Valente, Janice Harsanyi (apologies for the typo in the thumbnail, thanks to Colin Anderson for pointing that out), and Betty Allen.  Maw, a Brit, is present for this premiere.  Valente, Harsanyi and Allen are all familiar vocalists over these decades, and it is nice to hear Valente, who recently passed (typing this in early November of 2025).  The Maw, commissioned by the BBC and premiered at one of the BBC Proms, is not familiar but sounds like it's played very, very well, and all three vocalists are in terrific form.  When it received its world premiere in 1962, the work was hailed as a masterpiece, and Maw's refusal to abandon tonality was celebrated.  I left in the Beethoven, and I am glad I did.  As commenters observe, it's a far less dignified performance than the April 1964 commercial performance on Columbia, more percussive and unbuttoned.  EO lets the timpanist (Carlyss?  Bookspan?) turn up the volume substantially.",

    "Title": "Tchaik 3 Philadelphia Ormandy Oct 1974 Live",
    "Description": "Eugene Ormandy conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra in Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 3 (the \"Polish\").  This upload begins with an intermission interview with Austrian pianist Walter Klien, who in the first half of this concert (which celebrated the 100th birthday of Arnold Schoenberg) played Schoenberg's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, separately uploaded in this channel.  This performance of the Tchaikovsky is just beautiful and energetic, and interestingly follows the commercial recording session for RCA rather than vice versa.  (EO often used the live concerts as a rehearsal vehicle prior to recording, but not here.)  As other commenters observe, its energy compares favorably to the more polite commercial recording.  What a finale!",
