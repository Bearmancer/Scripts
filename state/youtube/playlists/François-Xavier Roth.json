    "Description": "Unusual harmonies, fascinating soundscapes, mysterious glitter. \u201CLa mer\u201D (The sea) by Claude Debussy is considered the showpiece of musical impressionism. Here it is played by the orchestra Les Si\u00E8cles under the direction of Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth. The concert took place in 2022 at the Prague Spring Festival in the famous Dvo\u0159\u00E1k Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague.\n\n(00:00) Coming on stage\n(00:25) I. De l\u2019aube \u00E0 midi sur la mer (From dawn to noon on the sea)\n(08:51) II. Jeux de vagues (Play of the waves)\n(15:41) III. Dialogue du vent et de la mer (Dialogue between wind and waves)\n\nClaude Debussy (1862 - 1918) wrote the composition of \u201Cthree symphonic sketches\u201D, between 1903 and 1905. Upon its premiere in Paris in October 1905, \u201CLa mer\u201D was not well-received, provoking confusion and dismay among both audience and critics. But after performances in the United States and Britain, it was performed again in Paris in 1908, and then quickly became one of Debussy\u0027s most famous and admired orchestral works.\n\nInspired by the Paris World Exhibition of 1889 with the construction of the Eiffel Tower, the works of Russian Romantic composers, contemporary salon music and the burgeoning jazz movement, Debussy wanted to create music that translated subjective impressions into atmospheric sounds. He thus developed a musical aesthetic that was no longer based on the conventions of Viennese Classicism and Romanticism, but instead followed an independent tonality. In his compositions, he combines European influences with Slavic and Asian music and uses major and minor scales as well as whole-tone scales and pentatonic elements.\n\nDebussy is neither interested in distinctive motifs nor in thematic elaborations and contrapuntal developments. Rather, his compositions are characterized by rapid harmonic changes and unusual instrumentation - such as a glockenspiel in \u201CLa mer\u201D. The composer\u0027s intention is to convey atmospheres and associations to the listener. Today, his impressionistic musical language is regarded as a link between Romanticism and musical modernism.\n\nFun fact: As a young boy, Debussy wanted to become a sailor. His longing for the sea is also reflected in his masterpiece \u201CLa mer\u201D.\n\nThe French orchestra Les Si\u00E8cles was founded in 2003 by conductor Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth. Translated, Les Si\u00E8cles means \u201Cthe centuries\u201D. The name says it all and stands for the conviction that the sound of past centuries manifests itself in the instruments of the time. This means that the musicians are committed to historically informed performance practice and play the particular works on period instruments.\n\n\u00A9 2022 CESKA TELEVIZE \n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#Debussy #LaMer #Impressionism",

    "Title": "Franck: Symphony in D minor | Les Si\u00E8cles \u0026 Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth",
    "Description": "It begins as a sombre night-time piece but ends in light: C\u00E9sar Franck\u0027s Symphony in D minor. The orchestra Les Si\u00E8cles performs under the direction of Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth. The concert took place in 2022 in the Dvo\u0159\u00E1k Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague. \n  \n(00:00) Applause \n(00:30) I. Lento \u2013 Allegro non troppo  \n(16:30) II. Allegretto \n(26:41) III. Allegro non troppo  \n \nC\u00E9sar Franck (1822 - 1890) composed two symphonies: the first, the Pr\u00E8miere Grande Symphony in G major, is an early work from 1836; the second, the Symphony in D minor (orig.: Symphonie en r\u00E9 mineur), belongs to Franck\u0027s late period. The Symphony in D minor (FWV 48) was composed between 1886 and 1888 and premiered on February 17, 1889. Franck dedicated it to his pupil Henri Duparc (1848 - 1933), who ended his musical career in 1885 as a result of a nervous disorder.  \n \nFranck\u0027s Symphony in D minor displays a distinct character. In terms of its sound and its frequent use of chromatic harmony, it is reminiscent of Richard Wagner\u0027s (1813 - 1883) music drama Tristan und Isolde (1865). Formally, Franck\u0027s symphony is far removed from its classical predecessors. Its form is defined by its cyclical structure, a compositional scheme frequently used in the Romantic period. Within this scheme, individual movements are generally linked by motifs and themes, lending multi-movement works a more unified feel.   \n \nIn his Symphony in D minor, Franck pushes the cyclical formal scheme to its limits. The three-movement symphony is based on a characteristic core motif that is heard right at the beginning. In the course of the symphony, this motif is varied in practically every musical respect: in instrumentation, timbre, dynamics, tempo, rhythm, keys, intervals and tone sequences. As a result, the entire symphonic work becomes a fabric with a wealth of interconnections. The famous term \u201Crelational magic\u201D, which the writer Thomas Mann used to characterize Richard Wagner\u0027s music, can certainly be applied to Franck\u0027s Symphony in D minor too. \n \nWhat is particularly exciting is how the French composer uses his sophisticated compositional technique to create an alternation of moods based on a minimal initial motif. The main motif in the low strings at the beginning of the symphony creates a dark and threatening atmosphere. As the orchestral work progresses, however, the mood becomes friendlier, and a radiant fanfare ultimately emerges at the very end of the late-Romantic symphony - and the oppressive beginning is forgotten. \n\nLes Si\u00E8cles is a French orchestra renowned for its diverse repertoire and historically informed performances. What sets the ensemble apart is its dedication to playing each work on period-appropriate instruments, faithfully capturing the sound and spirit of its time. Beyond the concert hall, Les Si\u00E8cles is deeply committed to music education and outreach, regularly performing in schools, hospitals, and prisons to bring music to a wider audience.\n\n\u00A9 2022 CESKA TELEVIZE \n\nFind more symphonies here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBXvpOWNmQ1AUBPQeyNanpxY\n\nCheck out more music from the Romantic period in our playlist ROMANTIC MUSIC:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBUCHNKKxIIM88sntDk1TVih\n\nAnd watch more concerts in YOUR PERSONAL CONCERT HALL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#romanticmusic #cesarfranck #symphonies",

    "Title": "Franck: The Accursed Huntsman | Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth \u0026 Les Si\u00E8cles",
    "Description": "Can a Romantic symphonic poem tell a thrilling horror story? Of course it can! Listen to The Accursed Huntsman by C\u00E9sar Franck. Watch the story played by the orchestra Les Si\u00E8cles under the direction of Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth in this video. The concert took place in 2022 in the magnificent Dvo\u0159\u00E1k Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague.\n\nC\u00E9sar Franck\u0027s (1822 - 1890) symphonic poem The Accursed Huntsman (originally Le Chasseur Maudit, FWV 44) from 1882 is a prime example of so-called program music - instrumental works that are based on a non-musical subject. In the case of The Accursed Huntsman, this is the ballad Der wilde J\u00E4ger (The Wild Huntsman) by German poet Gottfried August B\u00FCrger (1747 - 1794). The poem tells the story of a Rhineland count who goes hunting on a Sunday morning. This is considered to be sinful behavior because he should have gone to church. The awareness of sin is embodied by two horsemen flanking the count. The rider on the left tempts him to do evil, the one on the right wants him to do good. The count follows the evil one, who clearly is the devil himself, and this leads to a series of terrible crimes from the one initial sin: He has a farmer who admonishes him against hunting flogged and his fields trampled on. He unleashes a murderous bloodbath on a shepherd and his flock. He desecrates the chapel of a hermit. But then the raging hunter finds himself alone in the forest and hears a voice that curses him. As punishment, he is condemned to be hunted by demons for all eternity. The hunter becomes the hunted and experiences hell on earth.\n\nC\u00E9sar Franck\u0027s symphonic poem follows the literary source closely. The dramatic plot develops in four sections:\n(00:00) Applause\n(00:31) The Peaceful Sunday Landscape (Le Paysage paisible du Dimanche)\n(03:09) The Hunt (La Chasse)\n(08:37) The Curse (La Mal\u00E9diction)\n(10:34) The Demons\u2018 Chase (La Poursuite des D\u00E9mons)\n\nThe defining feature of all the sections is the hunting motif played by the horns right at the beginning. In the course of the one-movement orchestral piece, this striking motif becomes the leitmotif. Its varied forms represent the states of mind of the hunter. In the first section, the hunting motif radiates self-will and pride. It is self-confidently contrasted with the singing of the faithful in the church and the sound of the church bells. The second section sets the scene for the hunt. Franck expresses the hunter\u0027s inner conflict between good and evil, so vividly described in B\u00FCrger\u0027s ballad, by means of an echo: the hunting theme played by the horns is restrainedly repeated by the woodwinds. You immediately sense that something is wrong. As it progresses, the hunting theme is taken over by the whole orchestra,  and develops in a propulsive manner becoming increasingly aggressive. Three times the woodwinds counter with a softer melodic motif, which stands for the three victims of the hunter\u0027s crimes: the farmer (04:39), the shepherd (6:18) and the hermit (6:41); when the hunter suddenly finds himself alone in the forest and is afraid, the hunting motif is only heard in fragments and muted (07:22). In the third section, the curse against the count is heard in the low winds - but the theme of the curse also proves to be a variant of the hunting motif. In the fourth section, the hunting motif appears in a parodied form. Now it has been taken up by the demons surrounding the Count. The hunter has become the hunted. Shortly before the end of the tone poem, the bell sounds again, this time not as a harmonious church bell but as a monotonous death knell.\n\nWith The Accursed Huntsman, C\u00E9sar Franck once again proves himself to be a thoroughly Romantic composer. Popular Romantic subjects such as spooky horror stories with ghosts and supernatural forces or contradictions between outward action and inner states of mind are set to music perfectly here. The Accursed Huntsman is a successful example of how musical means can be used to tell an exciting story.\n\nLes Si\u00E8cles is a French orchestra renowned for its diverse repertoire and historically informed performances. What sets the ensemble apart is its dedication to playing each work on period-appropriate instruments, faithfully capturing the sound and spirit of its time.

    "Description": "Das G\u00FCrzenich-Orchester K\u00F6ln spielt \u00BBDes Spielmanns Kind\u00AB (1912) von Leo\u0161 Jan\u00E1\u010Dek mit Natalie Chee als Violinsolistin unter der Leitung von Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth.\n\nDie Aufnahme entstand bei einem Konzert-Livestream am 10. Mai 2022.\n\nAus einem Gedicht von Svatopluk \u010Cech machte  der Komponist eine (R\u00FCck-) Reise in die Bedr\u00FCckung der Provinz. Bei \u010Cech wird ein M\u00E4rchen erz\u00E4hlt:  Ein Spielmann ist gestorben, er hinterl\u00E4sst seine Violine und ein Baby. Die alte Frau, die das Waisenkind betreut, schl\u00E4ft an der Wiege ein. Der Geist  des Spielmanns erscheint, nimmt die Geige und lockt mit seinem Spiel das Kind in eine jenseitige Welt. Als die Betreuerin erwacht, ist das Kind tot,  die Geige verschwunden. Anders als im Gedicht spielt die alte Frau in der Musik keine Rolle, die Obrigkeit \u2013 bei \u010Cech knapp erw\u00E4hnt \u2013 daf\u00FCr umso mehr.  \u00BBDer Allm\u00E4chtige ist der Dorfrichter\u00AB, schreibt Jan\u00E1\u010Dek \u00FCber vier T\u00F6ne: kleine Terz aufw\u00E4rts, kleine Sekunde abw\u00E4rts, gro\u00DFe aufw\u00E4rts. Bedrohlich, auch wenn das in aller Schw\u00E4rze nur einmal, sp\u00E4t, von Posaunen und Tuba gespielt wird. \u00BBWohin er blickt, unterwerfen sich alle seinem Willen.\u00AB\n\nDieser Wille \u2013 oder eben die Dorfmoral \u2013 ist omnipr\u00E4sent. Man h\u00F6rt die Tonfolge schon anfangs in Fl\u00F6te und Fagott, bald nach dem ersten Thema der Solovioline, das den Tod des Spielmanns darstellt. Und in diese Tonfolge m\u00FCndet alles, am Ende wie in ergebener Verkl\u00E4rung in schimmernder H\u00F6he. Auf dem Weg dorthin: Das Spiel des Geistes an der Wiege als Reminiszenz an heitere Tage, die es auch einmal gab, dazu \u00BBgoldene Tr\u00E4ume\u00AB armer Leute, die nur  im Jenseits reich sein k\u00F6nnen. Im Orchester werden melancholische Episoden immer wieder von aggressiven K\u00FCrzeln durchzuckt, die wie Drohungen ohne Worte wirken.\n\nWie hier Emotionen, Stimmungen und Bestimmungen auf knappe Formeln gebracht und gegeneinander gesetzt werden, mitunter fast motorisch addiert, das zeigt den Musikdramatiker Jan\u00E1\u010Dek ebenso wie die Spannung des ganzen Werks \u2013 sie bleibt untergr\u00FCndig und f\u00FChrt zu keinem Happy End. Es ist, als habe der Spielmann das Kind vor einer Welt bewahren wollen, in der er selbst zugrunde ging. Jan\u00E1\u010Deks eigene Kinder lebten nicht mehr, als er die Komposition schuf: Sein Sohn war mit zwei Jahren, seine Tochter mit zwanzig gestorben. Die geplante Urauff\u00FChrung wurde \u00FCbrigens wegen zu knapper Probenzeit verschoben, die gedruckte Partitur bekam der Komponist zum Sechzigsten von Br\u00FCnner Bewunderern geschenkt \u2013 und dann begann der Erste Weltkrieg.\n\nwww.guerzenich-orchester.de",

    "Description": "Das G\u00FCrzenich-Orchester K\u00F6ln spielt \u00BBThe Viola in my Life IV\u00AB (1971) von Morton Feldman mit dem franz\u00F6sischen Bratschisten Antoine Tamestit unter der Leitung von Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth.\n\nDie Aufnahme entstand bei einem Konzert-Livestream am 10. Mai 2022.\n\nAntoine Tamestit zeigt erneut, was in der zu Unrecht oft im Schatten der Violine stehenden Bratsche alles steckt. Mit ihrem dunkel-samtenen Ton verf\u00FChrte sie auch den amerikanischen Komponisten Morton Feldman, der ihr einen vierteiligen Kompositionszyklus widmete. Nicht pralle Opulenz ist hier das Programm, sondern Kl\u00E4nge am Rande des noch H\u00F6rbaren. \u00BBThe Viola in my Life\u00AB webt magische Traumwelten und feiert die Macht der Stille.\n\nIn den f\u00FCnfzehn Minuten von \u00BBThe Viola in My Life IV\u00AB atmet man geradezu durch, weil es kein Ziel gibt. Bewegung schon. Einer geht los, offen f\u00FCr all das, was so am Weg sichtbar werden k\u00F6nnte \u2013 und im Kopf. Es ist die Klarheit eines Spaziergangs bei m\u00E4\u00DFig bew\u00F6lktem Himmel, in einer das Denken mild bef\u00F6rdernden Landschaft von einer bestimmten Farblichkeit: Gr\u00FCn, Grau, Blau vielleicht, eher als Gelb und Rot. In diesem Kosmos bewegt sich auch die Viola, nicht  gerade ein Instrument durchdringender T\u00F6ne, eher eines der Vermittlung und der Randzonen. Sie ist, mit\u00A0sparsamen T\u00F6nen und Fragmenten, das Subjekt, in dem sich Umgebung und Gedanken verbinden. Reminiszenzen auch, wie das erw\u00E4hnte Motiv aus  f\u00FCnf T\u00F6nen, von denen Feldman sagt, er setze sie  ein wie Robert Rauschenberg Fotos in seinen Bildern. Bei Feldman sind es Fotos aus einer anderen Zeit \u2013 vielleicht aus den Jahren, ehe sein Vater aus Russland nach New York kam, aus jenen Jahren, als es in Osteuropa noch Spielleute gab.\n\nEs ist alles ein gelassenes Gewahrwerden in dieser Musik, das sich auch verdichten kann wie in den acht Takten, in denen das Orchester ein Viertonmotiv wiederholt, bis es fast bedrohlich wird. Fast. \u00BBUnd dann vermassle ich alles\u00AB, sagte Feldman \u00FCber sein Vermeiden des Erwartbaren. \u00BBIch halte mich nicht  an den Weg.\u00AB Wenn man sich aber die Partitur  n\u00E4her anschaut, staunt man, wie viele Bez\u00FCge sich \u00BBby the way\u00AB ergeben. Die Klarheit, die offene Koh\u00E4renz, die wir erleben, ist einem konstruktiven Bewusstsein zu verdanken. Da ist dieses Fis der  Fl\u00F6ten, das einmal von der Seite kommt wie ein \u00FCberraschender Sonnenstrahl. Wenig sp\u00E4ter wird  das Fis zwei Oktaven tiefer zum Zustand, von zwei H\u00F6rnern, die einander abl\u00F6sen, seidig und sanft in  die Luft gelegt. Aber das \u00BBbedeutet\u00AB nichts. Es ist einfach da im Sehen, Denken, Dasein, im Leben.\n\nwww.guerzenich-orchetser.de",

It was only the second orchestration of Mussorgsky\u0027s piano set, the first being that by Mikhail Tushmalov, a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov. Like the Tushmalov version, Wood\u0027s is not complete, since he omits all but the first of the \u0027Promenades\u0027 and makes considerable changes and abridgements to the music throughout. However, when the Ravel version appeared a few years later, Wood\u0027s disappeared from view while Ravel\u0027s became the pre-eminent transcription of the work, still retaining its place today at the head of over 30 orchestrations by other composers and conductors.\n\nFor a Proms concert in 2010 at London\u0027s Royal Albert Hall, Sir Henry Wood\u0027s arrangement was given a rare revival by the National Orchestra of Wales under its Associate Guest Conductor, Francois-Xavier Roth. Gordon Jacob once described Wood\u0027s orchestration as \u0022superior in picturesqueness to Ravel\u0027s\u0022 with its astonishing array of orchestral effects. On the other hand, as the announcer says at the end, it is very \u0022over the top.\u0022 No wonder the Proms audience went wild!",

Mai 2022.\n\nEin Heldenleben, Pendant zur Tondichtung Don Quixote, die einem tragikomischen Helden gilt, ist ein erz\u00E4hlender R\u00FCckblick in sechs Stationen, geschaffen mit allen Mitteln der von Richard Wagner gelernten \u00DCberw\u00E4ltigungskunst und gewaltigem Orchester.\n\nStrauss braucht 34 Bl\u00E4ser, darunter acht H\u00F6rner, \u00BBdie nun doch einmal auf den Heroismus geeicht sind\u00AB, wie Strauss in Anspielung auf Beethovens \u00BBEroica\u00AB schreibt. Auch die steht in Es-Dur. Und auch \u00BBEin Heldenleben\u00AB folgt der Sonatenhauptsatzform, man findet eine Exposition mit zwei Themengruppen, Durchf\u00FChrung, Reprise, Coda. Doch das ist zweitrangig neben dem gro\u00DFen Kino, das Richard Strauss veranstaltet. \n\nDas bemerkte sein um zwei Jahre \u00E4lterer Kollege Claude Debussy bereits zu einer Zeit, als es nichts als kurze Stummfilme gab.

    "Description": "Th\u00E9odore Dubois \u2013 Piano Concerto No.2, Vanessa Wagner (piano Erard of 1874), Les Si\u00E8cles (orchestra), Fran\u00E7ois-Xavier Roth (conductor); live recording on the historical instruments\nI. Allegro \u2013 00:00\nII. Adagio (Con Sentimento Profondissimo) \u2013 10:55\nIII. Allegro Vivo, Scherzando \u2013 15:24\nIV. Con Molta Fantasia \u2013 17:55\n\nCl\u00E9ment Fran\u00E7ois Th\u00E9odore Dubois (24 August 1837 \u2013 11 June 1924) was a French composer, organist, and music teacher.\nAfter study at the Paris Conservatoire, Dubois won France\u0027s premier musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1861. He became an organist and choirmaster at several well-known churches in Paris, and at the same time was a professor at the Conservatoire, teaching harmony from 1871 to 1891 and composition from 1891 to 1896, when he succeeded Ambroise Thomas as the Conservatoire\u0027s director. He continued his predecessor\u0027s strictly conservative curriculum and was forced to retire early after a scandal erupted over the faculty\u0027s attempt to rig the Prix de Rome competition to prevent the modernist Maurice Ravel from winning.\nAfter his retirement from the Conservatoire, Dubois remained a familiar figure in Parisian musical circles. He was president of the association of Conservatoire alumni, and presided at its annual award ceremony.  Until his final years he remained vigorous. The death of his wife in 1923 was a blow from which he did not recover, and he died at his Paris home, after a short illness, on 11 June 1924, aged 86\nDubois was an consciencious musician, and considered to be representative of the classical school. While remaining faithful to his ideals of clarity and respect for tradition, he was receptive to the advanced ideas of his time. In his private capacity, Dubois was less reactionary than in the academic r\u00E9gime over which he presided. When Wagner\u0027s Parsifal had its belated Parisian premiere in 1914, Dubois said to his colleague Georges H\u00FCe that no music more beautiful had ever been written. Privately he was fascinated by Debussy\u0027s music, with its \u0022subtiles harmonies et les pr\u00E9cieux raffinements\u0022 \u2013 subtle harmonies and precious refinements.\nEclectic in its inspiration, his \u0153uvre is vast and varied, approaching every genre and identifying as much with C\u00E9sar Franck and Schumann as with Brahms or Saint-Sa\u00EBns, but in his extremely varied catalogue of works \n\nDubois showed no special enthusiasm for the concerto, probably because he was not himself a virtuoso of the front rank (although he was a genuinely talented organist). \n\n\u201C\u2018Very modern in style\u2019 a contemporary critic opined of the Piano Concerto No.2 of 1897. To me, though, it\u2019s rather Schumannesque in places but with hints too of Chopin and even Grieg with the piano often offering a decorative gloss on things. The orchestral accompaniment is, also, much more varied, some of it very lovely. The solo writing is not especially virtuosic per se, and that\u2019s to its advantage. The slow movement is quietly grave, opened by the piano, taken up by the orchestra, and subsequently embellished by the piano. The vital, energetic scherzo must owe a debt to Saint-Sa\u00EBns, even taking on a haba\u00F1era contour at one point. The finale, in the solo cadenza that launches it, strikes me as something of a Franck crib in places, though the recapitulation of earlier thematic material is neatly done and again the spirit of Saint-Sa\u00EBns continues to haunt the work, usefully dampening the somewhat half-hearted fugal passage. Academism is an ever-present worry with Dubois but here it\u2019s lightly conceived.\u201D (by Jonathan Woolf)",
