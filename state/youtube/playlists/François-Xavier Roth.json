Here it is played by the orchestra Les Siècles under the direction of François-Xavier Roth. The concert took place in 2022 at the Prague Spring Festival in the famous Dvořák Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague.\n\n(00:00) Coming on stage\n(00:25) I. De l’aube à midi sur la mer (From dawn to noon on the sea)\n(08:51) II. Jeux de vagues (Play of the waves)\n(15:41) III. Dialogue du vent et de la mer (Dialogue between wind and waves)\n\nClaude Debussy (1862 - 1918) wrote the composition of “three symphonic sketches”, between 1903 and 1905. Upon its premiere in Paris in October 1905, “La mer” was not well-received, provoking confusion and dismay among both audience and critics. But after performances in the United States and Britain, it was performed again in Paris in 1908, and then quickly became one of Debussy's most famous and admired orchestral works.\n\nInspired by the Paris World Exhibition of 1889 with the construction of the Eiffel Tower, the works of Russian Romantic composers, contemporary salon music and the burgeoning jazz movement, Debussy wanted to create music that translated subjective impressions into atmospheric sounds. He thus developed a musical aesthetic that was no longer based on the conventions of Viennese Classicism and Romanticism, but instead followed an independent tonality. In his compositions, he combines European influences with Slavic and Asian music and uses major and minor scales as well as whole-tone scales and pentatonic elements.\n\nDebussy is neither interested in distinctive motifs nor in thematic elaborations and contrapuntal developments. Rather, his compositions are characterized by rapid harmonic changes and unusual instrumentation - such as a glockenspiel in “La mer”. The composer's intention is to convey atmospheres and associations to the listener. Today, his impressionistic musical language is regarded as a link between Romanticism and musical modernism.\n\nFun fact: As a young boy, Debussy wanted to become a sailor. His longing for the sea is also reflected in his masterpiece “La mer”.\n\nThe French orchestra Les Siècles was founded in 2003 by conductor François-Xavier Roth. Translated, Les Siècles means “the centuries”. The name says it all and stands for the conviction that the sound of past centuries manifests itself in the instruments of the time. This means that the musicians are committed to historically informed performance practice and play the particular works on period instruments.\n\n© 2022 CESKA TELEVIZE \n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#Debussy #LaMer #Impressionism","Duration":"00:23:35","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"2sqIh61FXeA","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Elizabeth Ogonek - Sleep and Unremembrance: François-Xavier Roth conducting the LSO in 2016","Description":"François-Xavier Roth conducting the premiere of Elizabeth Ogonek's Sleep and Unremembrance with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican in March 2016.\n\nIntro: 0:00\nSleep and Unremembrance 0:04\n\nThis channel is not associated in any way with the London Symphony Orchestra, or its own CD label, LSO LIVE.

The orchestra Les Siècles performs under the direction of François-Xavier Roth. The concert took place in 2022 in the Dvořák Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague. \n  \n(00:00) Applause \n(00:30) I. Lento – Allegro non troppo  \n(16:30) II. Allegretto \n(26:41) III. Allegro non troppo  \n \nCésar Franck (1822 - 1890) composed two symphonies: the first, the Prèmiere Grande Symphony in G major, is an early work from 1836; the second, the Symphony in D minor (orig.: Symphonie en ré mineur), belongs to Franck's late period. The Symphony in D minor (FWV 48) was composed between 1886 and 1888 and premiered on February 17, 1889. Franck dedicated it to his pupil Henri Duparc (1848 - 1933), who ended his musical career in 1885 as a result of a nervous disorder.  \n \nFranck's Symphony in D minor displays a distinct character. In terms of its sound and its frequent use of chromatic harmony, it is reminiscent of Richard Wagner's (1813 - 1883) music drama Tristan und Isolde (1865). Formally, Franck's symphony is far removed from its classical predecessors. Its form is defined by its cyclical structure, a compositional scheme frequently used in the Romantic period. Within this scheme, individual movements are generally linked by motifs and themes, lending multi-movement works a more unified feel.   \n \nIn his Symphony in D minor, Franck pushes the cyclical formal scheme to its limits. The three-movement symphony is based on a characteristic core motif that is heard right at the beginning. In the course of the symphony, this motif is varied in practically every musical respect: in instrumentation, timbre, dynamics, tempo, rhythm, keys, intervals and tone sequences. As a result, the entire symphonic work becomes a fabric with a wealth of interconnections. The famous term “relational magic”, which the writer Thomas Mann used to characterize Richard Wagner's music, can certainly be applied to Franck's Symphony in D minor too. \n \nWhat is particularly exciting is how the French composer uses his sophisticated compositional technique to create an alternation of moods based on a minimal initial motif. The main motif in the low strings at the beginning of the symphony creates a dark and threatening atmosphere. As the orchestral work progresses, however, the mood becomes friendlier, and a radiant fanfare ultimately emerges at the very end of the late-Romantic symphony - and the oppressive beginning is forgotten. \n\nLes Siècles is a French orchestra renowned for its diverse repertoire and historically informed performances. What sets the ensemble apart is its dedication to playing each work on period-appropriate instruments, faithfully capturing the sound and spirit of its time. Beyond the concert hall, Les Siècles is deeply committed to music education and outreach, regularly performing in schools, hospitals, and prisons to bring music to a wider audience.\n\n© 2022 CESKA TELEVIZE \n\nFind more symphonies here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBXvpOWNmQ1AUBPQeyNanpxY\n\nCheck out more music from the Romantic period in our playlist ROMANTIC MUSIC:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBUCHNKKxIIM88sntDk1TVih\n\nAnd watch more concerts in YOUR PERSONAL CONCERT HALL:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#romanticmusic #cesarfranck #symphonies","Duration":"00:36:19","ChannelName":"DW Classical Music","VideoId":"Ir1bWTE0qDM","ChannelId":"UC_kqgIRwOD3XCZXXr4B6bPQ"},{"Title":"Franck: The Accursed Huntsman | François-Xavier Roth & Les Siècles","Description":"Can a Romantic symphonic poem tell a thrilling horror story? Of course it can! Listen to The Accursed Huntsman by César Franck. Watch the story played by the orchestra Les Siècles under the direction of François-Xavier Roth in this video. The concert took place in 2022 in the magnificent Dvořák Hall of the Rudolfinum in Prague.\n\nCésar Franck's (1822 - 1890) symphonic poem The Accursed Huntsman (originally Le Chasseur Maudit, FWV 44) from 1882 is a prime example of so-called program music - instrumental works that are based on a non-musical subject. In the case of The Accursed Huntsman, this is the ballad Der wilde Jäger (The Wild Huntsman) by German poet Gottfried August Bürger (1747 - 1794). The poem tells the story of a Rhineland count who goes hunting on a Sunday morning. This is considered to be sinful behavior because he should have gone to church. The awareness of sin is embodied by two horsemen flanking the count. The rider on the left tempts him to do evil, the one on the right wants him to do good. The count follows the evil one, who clearly is the devil himself, and this leads to a series of terrible crimes from the one initial sin: He has a farmer who admonishes him against hunting flogged and his fields trampled on. He unleashes a murderous bloodbath on a shepherd and his flock. He desecrates the chapel of a hermit. But then the raging hunter finds himself alone in the forest and hears a voice that curses him. As punishment, he is condemned to be hunted by demons for all eternity. The hunter becomes the hunted and experiences hell on earth.\n\nCésar Franck's symphonic poem follows the literary source closely. The dramatic plot develops in four sections:\n(00:00) Applause\n(00:31) The Peaceful Sunday Landscape (Le Paysage paisible du Dimanche)\n(03:09) The Hunt (La Chasse)\n(08:37) The Curse (La Malédiction)\n(10:34) The Demons‘ Chase (La Poursuite des Démons)\n\nThe defining feature of all the sections is the hunting motif played by the horns right at the beginning. In the course of the one-movement orchestral piece, this striking motif becomes the leitmotif. Its varied forms represent the states of mind of the hunter. In the first section, the hunting motif radiates self-will and pride. It is self-confidently contrasted with the singing of the faithful in the church and the sound of the church bells. The second section sets the scene for the hunt. Franck expresses the hunter's inner conflict between good and evil, so vividly described in Bürger's ballad, by means of an echo: the hunting theme played by the horns is restrainedly repeated by the woodwinds. You immediately sense that something is wrong. As it progresses, the hunting theme is taken over by the whole orchestra,  and develops in a propulsive manner becoming increasingly aggressive. Three times the woodwinds counter with a softer melodic motif, which stands for the three victims of the hunter's crimes: the farmer (04:39), the shepherd (6:18) and the hermit (6:41); when the hunter suddenly finds himself alone in the forest and is afraid, the hunting motif is only heard in fragments and muted (07:22). In the third section, the curse against the count is heard in the low winds - but the theme of the curse also proves to be a variant of the hunting motif. In the fourth section, the hunting motif appears in a parodied form. Now it has been taken up by the demons surrounding the Count. The hunter has become the hunted. Shortly before the end of the tone poem, the bell sounds again, this time not as a harmonious church bell but as a monotonous death knell.\n\nWith The Accursed Huntsman, César Franck once again proves himself to be a thoroughly Romantic composer. Popular Romantic subjects such as spooky horror stories with ghosts and supernatural forces or contradictions between outward action and inner states of mind are set to music perfectly here. The Accursed Huntsman is a successful example of how musical means can be used to tell an exciting story.\n\nLes Siècles is a French orchestra renowned for its diverse repertoire and historically informed performances.

Mai 2022.\n\nAus einem Gedicht von Svatopluk Čech machte  der Komponist eine (Rück-) Reise in die Bedrückung der Provinz. Bei Čech wird ein Märchen erzählt:  Ein Spielmann ist gestorben, er hinterlässt seine Violine und ein Baby. Die alte Frau, die das Waisenkind betreut, schläft an der Wiege ein. Der Geist  des Spielmanns erscheint, nimmt die Geige und lockt mit seinem Spiel das Kind in eine jenseitige Welt. Als die Betreuerin erwacht, ist das Kind tot,  die Geige verschwunden. Anders als im Gedicht spielt die alte Frau in der Musik keine Rolle, die Obrigkeit – bei Čech knapp erwähnt – dafür umso mehr.  »Der Allmächtige ist der Dorfrichter«, schreibt Janáček über vier Töne: kleine Terz aufwärts, kleine Sekunde abwärts, große aufwärts. Bedrohlich, auch wenn das in aller Schwärze nur einmal, spät, von Posaunen und Tuba gespielt wird. »Wohin er blickt, unterwerfen sich alle seinem Willen.«\n\nDieser Wille – oder eben die Dorfmoral – ist omnipräsent. Man hört die Tonfolge schon anfangs in Flöte und Fagott, bald nach dem ersten Thema der Solovioline, das den Tod des Spielmanns darstellt. Und in diese Tonfolge mündet alles, am Ende wie in ergebener Verklärung in schimmernder Höhe. Auf dem Weg dorthin: Das Spiel des Geistes an der Wiege als Reminiszenz an heitere Tage, die es auch einmal gab, dazu »goldene Träume« armer Leute, die nur  im Jenseits reich sein können. Im Orchester werden melancholische Episoden immer wieder von aggressiven Kürzeln durchzuckt, die wie Drohungen ohne Worte wirken.\n\nWie hier Emotionen, Stimmungen und Bestimmungen auf knappe Formeln gebracht und gegeneinander gesetzt werden, mitunter fast motorisch addiert, das zeigt den Musikdramatiker Janáček ebenso wie die Spannung des ganzen Werks – sie bleibt untergründig und führt zu keinem Happy End. Es ist, als habe der Spielmann das Kind vor einer Welt bewahren wollen, in der er selbst zugrunde ging. Janáčeks eigene Kinder lebten nicht mehr, als er die Komposition schuf: Sein Sohn war mit zwei Jahren, seine Tochter mit zwanzig gestorben. Die geplante Uraufführung wurde übrigens wegen zu knapper Probenzeit verschoben, die gedruckte Partitur bekam der Komponist zum Sechzigsten von Brünner Bewunderern geschenkt – und dann begann der Erste Weltkrieg.\n\nwww.guerzenich-orchester.de","Duration":"00:15:18","ChannelName":"Gürzenich-Orchester Köln","VideoId":"dMpKedFA4SI","ChannelId":"UC9ZTxQYqbsGfBOGvNsaIz8w"},{"Title":"Luciano Berio - Symphony: François-Xavier Roth conducting the LSO in 2016","Description":"A rare LSO performance of Berio's Symphony at the Barbican in 2016 under the orchestra's Principal Guest Conductor, François-Xavier Roth.\n\n\nThis channel is not associated in any way with the London Symphony Orchestra, or its own CD label, LSO LIVE.

Nicht pralle Opulenz ist hier das Programm, sondern Klänge am Rande des noch Hörbaren. »The Viola in my Life« webt magische Traumwelten und feiert die Macht der Stille.\n\nIn den fünfzehn Minuten von »The Viola in My Life IV« atmet man geradezu durch, weil es kein Ziel gibt. Bewegung schon. Einer geht los, offen für all das, was so am Weg sichtbar werden könnte – und im Kopf. Es ist die Klarheit eines Spaziergangs bei mäßig bewölktem Himmel, in einer das Denken mild befördernden Landschaft von einer bestimmten Farblichkeit: Grün, Grau, Blau vielleicht, eher als Gelb und Rot. In diesem Kosmos bewegt sich auch die Viola, nicht  gerade ein Instrument durchdringender Töne, eher eines der Vermittlung und der Randzonen. Sie ist, mit\u00A0sparsamen Tönen und Fragmenten, das Subjekt, in dem sich Umgebung und Gedanken verbinden. Reminiszenzen auch, wie das erwähnte Motiv aus  fünf Tönen, von denen Feldman sagt, er setze sie  ein wie Robert Rauschenberg Fotos in seinen Bildern. Bei Feldman sind es Fotos aus einer anderen Zeit – vielleicht aus den Jahren, ehe sein Vater aus Russland nach New York kam, aus jenen Jahren, als es in Osteuropa noch Spielleute gab.\n\nEs ist alles ein gelassenes Gewahrwerden in dieser Musik, das sich auch verdichten kann wie in den acht Takten, in denen das Orchester ein Viertonmotiv wiederholt, bis es fast bedrohlich wird. Fast. »Und dann vermassle ich alles«, sagte Feldman über sein Vermeiden des Erwartbaren. »Ich halte mich nicht  an den Weg.« Wenn man sich aber die Partitur  näher anschaut, staunt man, wie viele Bezüge sich »by the way« ergeben. Die Klarheit, die offene Kohärenz, die wir erleben, ist einem konstruktiven Bewusstsein zu verdanken. Da ist dieses Fis der  Flöten, das einmal von der Seite kommt wie ein überraschender Sonnenstrahl. Wenig später wird  das Fis zwei Oktaven tiefer zum Zustand, von zwei Hörnern, die einander ablösen, seidig und sanft in  die Luft gelegt. Aber das »bedeutet« nichts. Es ist einfach da im Sehen, Denken, Dasein, im Leben.\n\nwww.guerzenich-orchetser.de","Duration":"00:18:16","ChannelName":"Gürzenich-Orchester Köln","VideoId":"D_Lz9OqBACg","ChannelId":"UC9ZTxQYqbsGfBOGvNsaIz8w"},{"Title":"MOZART - Les Siècles, François-Xavier Roth, Renaud Capuçon, Adrien La Marca - Gstaad","Description":"W.

It was only the second orchestration of Mussorgsky's piano set, the first being that by Mikhail Tushmalov, a pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov. Like the Tushmalov version, Wood's is not complete, since he omits all but the first of the 'Promenades' and makes considerable changes and abridgements to the music throughout. However, when the Ravel version appeared a few years later, Wood's disappeared from view while Ravel's became the pre-eminent transcription of the work, still retaining its place today at the head of over 30 orchestrations by other composers and conductors.\n\nFor a Proms concert in 2010 at London's Royal Albert Hall, Sir Henry Wood's arrangement was given a rare revival by the National Orchestra of Wales under its Associate Guest Conductor, Francois-Xavier Roth. Gordon Jacob once described Wood's orchestration as \"superior in picturesqueness to Ravel's\" with its astonishing array of orchestral effects. On the other hand, as the announcer says at the end, it is very \"over the top.\" No wonder the Proms audience went wild!","Duration":"00:31:37","ChannelName":"adam28xx","VideoId":"FeErAbMS6t8","ChannelId":"UCJbfiRvOlcTfHrbi98L9IZA"},{"Title":"Olga Neuwirth: »Spraying Sounds of Hope«⎮François-Xavier Roth⎮Gürzenich-Orchester Köln","Description":"Olga Neuwirths Werk »Spraying Sounds of Hope« für Blechbläser und Schlagwerk setzt ein kraftvolles Zeichen der Zuversicht.

Auch die steht in Es-Dur. Und auch »Ein Heldenleben« folgt der Sonatenhauptsatzform, man findet eine Exposition mit zwei Themengruppen, Durchführung, Reprise, Coda. Doch das ist zweitrangig neben dem großen Kino, das Richard Strauss veranstaltet. \n\nDas bemerkte sein um zwei Jahre älterer Kollege Claude Debussy bereits zu einer Zeit, als es nichts als kurze Stummfilme gab. Als Strauss im März 1903 sein Werk in Paris dirigierte, resümierte Debussy: »Das ist ein Bilderbuch, das ist sogar Kino ...« Strauss denke »in farbigen Bildern«, er scheine  »die Linienzüge seiner Ideen mit dem Orchester nachzuzeichnen«.\n\nAber wer ist dieser Held, dessen Ruhmeslauf mit seinen Kämpfen, Glücksmomenten und schließlich einer prunkenden Apotheose uns da in Breitwand-Opulenz geschildert wird?

Allegro – 00:00\nII. Adagio (Con Sentimento Profondissimo) – 10:55\nIII. Allegro Vivo, Scherzando – 15:24\nIV. Con Molta Fantasia – 17:55\n\nClément François Théodore Dubois (24 August 1837 – 11 June 1924) was a French composer, organist, and music teacher.\nAfter study at the Paris Conservatoire, Dubois won France's premier musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1861. He became an organist and choirmaster at several well-known churches in Paris, and at the same time was a professor at the Conservatoire, teaching harmony from 1871 to 1891 and composition from 1891 to 1896, when he succeeded Ambroise Thomas as the Conservatoire's director. He continued his predecessor's strictly conservative curriculum and was forced to retire early after a scandal erupted over the faculty's attempt to rig the Prix de Rome competition to prevent the modernist Maurice Ravel from winning.\nAfter his retirement from the Conservatoire, Dubois remained a familiar figure in Parisian musical circles. He was president of the association of Conservatoire alumni, and presided at its annual award ceremony.  Until his final years he remained vigorous. The death of his wife in 1923 was a blow from which he did not recover, and he died at his Paris home, after a short illness, on 11 June 1924, aged 86\nDubois was an consciencious musician, and considered to be representative of the classical school. While remaining faithful to his ideals of clarity and respect for tradition, he was receptive to the advanced ideas of his time. In his private capacity, Dubois was less reactionary than in the academic régime over which he presided. When Wagner's Parsifal had its belated Parisian premiere in 1914, Dubois said to his colleague Georges Hüe that no music more beautiful had ever been written. Privately he was fascinated by Debussy's music, with its \"subtiles harmonies et les précieux raffinements\" – subtle harmonies and precious refinements.\nEclectic in its inspiration, his œuvre is vast and varied, approaching every genre and identifying as much with César Franck and Schumann as with Brahms or Saint-Saëns, but in his extremely varied catalogue of works \n\nDubois showed no special enthusiasm for the concerto, probably because he was not himself a virtuoso of the front rank (although he was a genuinely talented organist). \n\n“‘Very modern in style’ a contemporary critic opined of the Piano Concerto No.2 of 1897. To me, though, it’s rather Schumannesque in places but with hints too of Chopin and even Grieg with the piano often offering a decorative gloss on things. The orchestral accompaniment is, also, much more varied, some of it very lovely. The solo writing is not especially virtuosic per se, and that’s to its advantage. The slow movement is quietly grave, opened by the piano, taken up by the orchestra, and subsequently embellished by the piano. The vital, energetic scherzo must owe a debt to Saint-Saëns, even taking on a habañera contour at one point. The finale, in the solo cadenza that launches it, strikes me as something of a Franck crib in places, though the recapitulation of earlier thematic material is neatly done and again the spirit of Saint-Saëns continues to haunt the work, usefully dampening the somewhat half-hearted fugal passage. Academism is an ever-present worry with Dubois but here it’s lightly conceived.” (by Jonathan Woolf)","Duration":"00:24:35","ChannelName":"sibarit101","VideoId":"FuM4nybsKhQ","ChannelId":"UC7ojalnVGxhYFUJQNtHRuuA"},{"Title":"Vito Žuraj | »Unveiled« (2020/2021) | Gürzenich-Orchester Köln | François-Xavier Roth","Description":"Jean-Guihen Queyras spielt »Unveiled« Konzert für Violoncello und Orchester (2020/2021)* von Vito Žuraj zusammen mit dem Gürzenich-Orchester Köln unter der Leitung von François-Xavier Roth.\n\n*Deutsche Erstaufführung.
