He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884, by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension.\n\nPlease support my channel:\nhttps://ko-fi.com/bartjebartmans\n\nPiano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, Op. 23 (1874-75)\nDedication: Hans von B\u00FClow\n\n1. Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso\u2014Allegro con spirito (0:00)\n2. Andantino semplice\u2014Allegro vivace assai (18:42)\n3. Allegro con fuoco (25:07)\n\nLeonard Pennario, piano and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Erich Leinsdorf\nrec. 1965\n\nLeonard Pennario (July 9, 1924 \u2013 June 27, 2008) was also a composer. Here you can listen to Midnight From the Cliffs from the movie Julie (1956) starring Doris Day.\nhttps://youtu.be/bsfVL0nJe5E?si=8-CCbCWwHJ5L0OHA\n\nDescription by Joseph Stevenson  [-]\nAlthough Tchaikovsky was already an accomplished composer (having already produced his first two symphonies, a string quartet, and two notable tone poems, all of these successful and enduring works), he still sought the approval of mentors such as Balakirev and Nicolas Rubinstein. On Christmas Eve 1874 he played the concerto for Rubinstein (its intended soloist) in an empty classroom. Rubinstein responded with a torrent of castigation, made famous by Tchaikovsky\u0027s own recollection. Tchaikovsky slunk off in despair. Later Rubinstein called him back and detailed a list of changes that must be made by a certain date if Rubinstein were to perform it. Tchaikovsky wrote that he responded, \u0022I shall not change a single note, and I shall publish the concerto as it is now.\u0022 He continued in his reminiscence, \u0022And this, indeed, I did.\u0022 Well, not entirely. Although there are no really substantial changes, he did subject the concerto to some minor revision before it was printed, as happens with most compositions. The premiere fell to Hans von B\u00FClow, who played it first in Boston, October 15, 1875. The audience was enraptured and demanded a repeat of the entire final movement. Von B\u00FClow took the concerto back to Europe, where it was quickly added to the repertoire of other leading pianists; even Rubinstein started playing it in 1878. It has been a giant success, virtually the epitome of the romantic piano concerto, ever since.\n\nThe form of the concerto is lopsided: possessing a notably large scale introduction, the broad melodies of the first movement run its length out to nearly 25 minutes, more than the length of the two remaining movements combined. Its arresting opening horn call, with bold orchestral chords interrupting, leads immediately to one of the most recognizable and beloved of classical melodies, played by strings with rich harmonic support from the piano solo. Tchaikovsky initiates a great formal surprise by going straightway into a full-fledged cadenza for the piano solo, a powerful treatment of the theme. The strings then reassert the melody in its original form -- and all this is only the introduction to the first movement proper. A lengthy introduction to be sure (106 measures), but once it ends, that\u0027s the last time in the concerto this music is used in any way. The movement proper is a full-scale sonata-allegro treatment of two themes, one reputedly a Ukrainian folk theme, the other a gentle romantic theme. There is great drama and passion in its working out; when it is all over one realizes that there is also a minimum (for Tchaikovsky) of angst and pathos.\n\nThe second movement is tender, beginning with pizzicato chords so quiet as to be almost whispers. A flute melody of young adolescent tenderness is the main theme of the movement. There is a central section with a delicate waltz.\n\nThe finale opens with a rushing string figure and a powerful drum stroke. The main theme is an arresting, galloping dance made up of many short phrases. Yet another romantic theme provides contrast.",

    "Title": "Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 in B Flat Minor Op. 23 - Horowitz; Arturo Toscanini 1943 - (Score)",
    "Description": "Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 in B Flat Minor Op. 23 - Vladimir Horowitz; Arturo Toscanini 1943 \nNBC Symphony Orchestra - April 25 1943 - LIVE - In concert at Carnegie Hall NYC\n\nRecording used: https://youtu.be/4ksVduF2rr4?si=maUaSjIUv0293xR4\nSs sabu Apr 30 2012 - I DO NOT Own the audio. \n\n\nIn my opinion, undebatebly the finest rendition, especially live performance, of Tchaikovsky\u2019s First Piano Concerto, my favourite piece of him and my favourite pianist.  Best Horowitz recording out of many for this piece due to the cleanliness, sound quality, unison with orchestra, and the tempo. I was thinking of also scoring his 1953 recording because that is also amazing but I found it not his best playing due to the mistakes and especially the end where the tempo got too messy and quick unlike this recording. This one is just so unbelievably powerful, and in all aspects beats all modern recordings including Martha Argerich and is more exciting than Van Cliburns. I am really fond of the fast tempo compared to others where it gets as long as 38 minutes, 31 minutes is perfect to fit all the musicality inside, and it allows for better climaxes. \n\n\nNotes:\nThe Opening theme is one of the most universal melodies in classical music and is one of the grandest piano openings in any piano concerto. It really sounds like Mr. Beast\u2019s theme song! Anyway, it is played amazingly with a power in the bass. \n4:20 sounds great especially with the octaves played so close together with more staccato and lightness compared to Argerich. \n5:35 is one of my favourite parts and is such a satisfying part to listen to, and his rendition just is perfect for me. I feel like he plays with lots of directness and no dynamics which allows it to flow better. If it is played with too much dynamics like Argerich it distracts it. \n5:48 I was originally very confused and disappointed that he didn\u2019t play the bass A and B Flat but I can now see why he didn\u2019t. It sounds more subtle and right to play it higher and it emphasizes the b flats after each phrase. I did remove the signs to play octave lower it from the score to match his playing. \n6:14 is so beautiful and makes me cry when I listen, and Horowitz voicing is impeccable. He manages to make the bass, treble and melody sound so sad and it is stunning. Likewise for 7:07. \n7:30 - AMAZING and so emotional in just a few seconds, and only Horowitz can create that type of sound. 7:35 I do appreciate and agree with the subtlty in the bass and you can only hear it a little bit. \n8:00 - due to the buildup and loudness the climax sounds like the ending of the movement but the first movement is not even half way done yet! The octaves are extremely impressive due to the stability and stamina and here its just so perfect. Love the staccato and ferocity and how he manages to not make mistakes with the leaps. Almost the same tempo as the octaves in Alkan\u2019s La preux. \n8:47 - Such lightness and beauty in these arpegious. Makes the piano sound like birds singing combined with the orchestra.\n12:33 - Love ferocity in bass. \n16:10 - Octaves are so intense and the spiky dynamics go so well. \n22:29 - love the way the mini tremolos are played. \n27:00 - Great staccato\nFinally, the long awaited climax at 30:30, and definitely the loudest moment in the piece. Immediately you notice that despite Tchaikovsky\u2019s instruction, he doesn\u2019t an octave higher, which honestly I wish he did but I can see why he didn\u2019t for basically the same reason as 5:48 and the lower notes allow the piano and its melody to be more centered and stand out. But its weird because the climax in the high treble is the same in the end of Rachmoninoff 3rd. But also the lower notes allow for more excitement when he plays a high b flat in the very end which I truly enjoy the addon. The overall climax is played absolutely wonderfully. It is clear, in time, and perfect despite the extreme technical difficulties. \nThe NBC Orchestra and Arthur Toscanini did an outstanding job with this piece and especially playing with Horowitz fast tempo. Everything is so in sync. The sound is suplime both in the orchestra and the piano. \nAnyway, thanks for reading if you did, thanks so much for watching and viewing my channel. Means a lot. This is a great quality score video and was fun to make. Better quality than most score videos on this and as you know I always use the whole score with piano concertos to highlight to composers genuineness and all the instruments.",

German pianist Conrad Hansen (1906-2002) gives an excellent performance along with the RIAS Orchestra directed by Wolfgang Sawallisch.\n\nThis recording was made in the Fall of 1953.  It was first released first Remington Records, and then four years later on Masterseal - both companies owned by Don Gabor.   As with some other Remington re-releases, the improvements in engineering and vinyl during the 1950s made for a better sounding record the second time around.

    "Description": "The very first bars of this piano concerto are so distinctive that they will remain in the listener\u0027s memory forever. Tchaikovsky\u0027s Piano Concerto No. 1 is recognizable and catchy. Charismatic piano virtuoso Martha Argerich lends an elegant lightness to this impressive piece. Conducted by Charles Dutoit, Argerich performed with the Verbier Festival Orchestra at the Verbier Festival in 2014.\n\n(00:00) Coming on stage\n(00:18) I. Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso \n(20:36) II. Andantino semplice \n(27:38) III. Allegro con fuoco \n\n(35:53) Encore: Robert Schumann: \u201CScenes from Childhood,\u201D Op. 15, No. 1\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is considered the most important Russian composer of the 19th century. He was born in 1840 in Votkinsk and studied at the St. Petersburg Conservatory with Anton Rubinstein from 1862. His compositions combined Russian folk music with western music influences. Tchaikovsky wrote several symphonies and operas, as well as \u0022The Nutcracker\u0022 and \u0022Swan Lake,\u0022 the most famous ballets in music history.\n\nPiano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, Op, 23 is considered one of the most popular piano works to this day. Tchaikovsky completed it in 1875, the same year it premiered in Boston. With its concise, rhythmic runs and its focused energy, it thrilled audiences then as it does today.\n\nArgentine-Swiss pianist Martha Argerich is considered a \u0022lioness of piano.\u0022 Born in Buenos Aires in 1941, she moved to Europe with her family in 1955. Argerich gave her first concert at the age of seven. In 1965, as a young woman, she won the legendary International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, which was considered a sensation at the time and helped her rise to stardom. Since then, she has played with leading orchestras in the most renowned concert halls in the world. In 2005, she received the acclaimed and prestigious \u0022Praemium Imperiale.\u0022 Marta Argerich is considered a living musical legend.\n\nBorn in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1936, conductor Charles Dutoit has had a stellar musical career. He has conducted more than 150 orchestras over the span of his long career. In 1977, he became the artistic director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and recorded more than 80 CDs. Dutoit and Argerich were married for several years. In 2017/18 Charles Dutoit faced #MeToo allegations and was the center of sexual harassment scandal which led to several orchestras cutting ties with the star conductor.\n\nThe Verbier Festival Orchestra is made up of highly talented young musicians and was founded in 2000. It offers young artists the opportunity to gain concert experience under the direction of leading conductors.\n\nThe Verbier Festival is considered the summit meeting of classical music stars. It has been held once a year in the Swiss Alps since 1994. In addition to the extensive concert program, the festival offers up-and-coming artists an opportunity to work with the very great artists of the classical music scene. Martha Argerich is a regular guest at the festival.\n\n\u00A9 Id\u00E9ale Audience \u0026 MUSEEC / medici.tv\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#tchaikovsky #marthaargerich #pianoconcerto",
