    "Description": "Anton Bruckner (1824-1896)\nSymphony No. 4 \u0022Romantic\u0022\n\nconductor: Herbert Blomstedt\norchestra: Wiener Philharmoniker (Vienna Philharmonic)\nsolo horn: Manuel Huber\n\nRecorded live in the gro\u00DFe Musikvereinssaal on April 30 2017.\n\n\nIMHO, when it comes to Bruckner, especially to the Fourth Symphony, no orchestra even comes close to matching the Vienna Philharmonic. \nIt\u0027s not a case that this orchestra premiered the \u0022Romantic\u0022 under the baton of the legendary conductor Hans Richter in 1881.\nListen to the beautifully played horn call at the beginning: it simply sounds better on the Vienna horn than on the standard double horn. This special instrument gives to the tone that rustic and ancient edge that went lost on the modern instrument.\n\nI think that this performance will go down as one of the most unforgettable of the recent years. The merit goes to the Vienna Philharmonic and to its players - especially to Manuel Huber, their solo horn player - but also to Herbert Blomstedt.\n\nThis conductor has something special when it comes to Bruckner: he has lots of respect for the composer and you can hear this from all his performances. His interpretations are always very natural and the music flows with the utmost simplicity. Something very different from, let\u0027s say, Daniel Barenboim, whose interpretations I sometimes find a little too artificial and intellectual.\n\nThere\u0027s nothing intellectual in Bruckner. He was not a Viennese, he came from the Austrian countryside. His ancestors were farmers and craftsmen and his father was a schoolmaster. He was a simple,  humble and naive man, who has never been accepted among the close circle of Viennese intellectuals and did not achieve the deserved success until the very last years of his life.\n\nThe harmonic structure of his music is very achitectural and detailed, but the musical material is the most simple imaginable as it is the message that is behind his music: love, hope, faith in Almighty God.\n\nPlease, enjoy!",

    "Description": "It was the high point of Leipzig\u2019s tenth anniversary celebrations of German reunification \u2013 Ludwig van Beethoven\u0027s Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67, performed by the Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig and conducted by Herbert Blomstedt. The commemorative concert was held in the St. Nicholas Church on October 9, 1999.\n\nA key moment in history occurred in Leipzig \u2013 the former GDR\u2019s second-largest city \u2013 on October 9, 1989, when some 70,000 Leipzig residents overcame their fear of their authoritarian state to demonstrate for freedom, and increased democracy. This \u2018Monday demonstration\u2018 as it would become known ran peacefully, despite mounting political tensions, and would become one of the events that lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, one month later. \n\nThe demonstrators\u0027 rallying cry of \u0022Wir sind das Volk!\u201C \u2013 we are the people \u2013 was picked up again for this concert, where the fateful turn of history was to be commemorated with this performance of Beethoven\u0027s Fifth, also known as his \u0027Fateful Symphony\u0027. It\u2018s said to have received the additional epithet by way of a bon mot from the composer himself. Speaking of its four opening notes and their famous rhythm, Beethoven is reported to have said \u0022Thus, fate knocks at the door!\u0022\n\nThis interpretation by the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Herbert Blomstedt, is positively ponderous in tempo, meaning one can listen intently to each twist and turn of Beethoven\u0027s symphony. In commemoration of that crucial day in Leipzig so shortly before the shift in the tide of world politics, this artistic choice certainly works to underscore the slow turning of fate.\n\n(00:00) I.

    "Title": "Beethoven: Symphony No. 7 | Herbert Blomstedt \u0026 the Gewandhaus Orchestra (2015)",
    "Description": "Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92, is \u201Cthe symphony par excellence\u201D \u2013 this was the opinion of no less a figure than the famous philosopher, sociologist, and musicologist Theodor W. Adorno. The 7th Symphony, radiating joy and a positive attitude towards life, will be performed by the Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig under the direction of Herbert Blomstedt. The concert took place in May 2015 at the Gewandhaus Leipzig.\n\n(00:00) I. Poco sostenuto \u2013 Vivace\n(14:29) II. Allegretto\n(22:42) III. Presto\n(31:27) IV. Allegro con brio\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770 \u2013 1827) composed Symphony No. 7 in A major between September 1811 and around April 1812. The handwritten score lists May 13, 1812, as the date of completion. Beethoven stated that he always had the whole in mind when composing his Seventh. Indeed, the entire symphony is permeated by rhythmic motifs in which an opening motif is repeated, developed, and varied. This gives the 7th Symphony not only its cohesive effect but also its momentum. Richard Wagner (1813 \u2013 1883) therefore called this Beethoven symphony an \u201Capotheosis of dance.\u201D\n\nThe premiere of Symphony No. 7 took place on December 8, 1813 in Vienna under Beethoven himself. Although his hearing was already severely impaired at this time, Beethoven was at the height of his fame and was even considered the greatest instrumental composer of his time. With the 7th Symphony, the classical composer celebrated one of his greatest successes \u2013 not least because the symphonic work was performed at exactly the right historical moment: from October 16 to 19, 1813, the so-called \u201CBattle of the Nations at Leipzig\u201D took place, which marked the beginning of the retreat of Napoleon\u2019s troops from Germany. A patriotically charged benefit concert was held for the victorious anti-Napoleonic fighters \u2013 the perfect occasion for Beethoven\u2019s cheerfully optimistic Symphony No. 7. Beethoven\u2019s patriotic zeal was already praised in the reviews of the symphony\u2019s premiere, and so from the outset the great orchestral work was placed in the context of the Wars of Liberation from Napoleon\u2019s rule \u2013 even though it has already been completed beforehand.\n\nThe Swedish conductor Herbert Blomstedt was director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig from 1998 to 2005. He returns to the Saxon city annually to perform with \u201Chis\u201D former orchestra. The 2015 concert revives the collaboration between the internationally sought-after conductor and Germany\u2019s top orchestra \u2013 and Maestro Blomstedt, then almost 88 years old, appears as vibrant as ever.\n\n\u00A9 2015 Accentus Music\n\nWatch more concerts in your personal concert hall:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBV5A14dyRWy1KSkwcG8LEey \n\nin our playlist with famous symphonies:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBXvpOWNmQ1AUBPQeyNanpxY\n\nand in our Beethoven playlist: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_SdnzPd3eBWcX1eOXH-w75x-_-7gRF-w \n\nSubscribe to DW Classical Music: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/dwclassicalmusic\n\n#Beethoven #Symphony #Blomstedt",

    "Description": "The Symphony No. 67 in F major, Hoboken I/67, is a symphony by Joseph Haydn. It was composed by 1779. H. C. Robbins Landon praises this work, saying \u0022without any question, this is one of the most boldly original symphonies of this period.\u0022 \n1. Presto, 6/8 0:25\n2. Adagio B-flat major, 2/4 9:02\n3. Menuetto \u0026 Trio, 3/4 17:10\n4. Finale: Allegro di molto, 2/2 - Adagio e cantabile,3/8 - Allegro di molto, 2/2 20:30\nThis is the only symphony where Haydn opens in fast 6/8 time without a slow introduction. \nAt the end of the second movement, the entire string section is directed to play col legno dell\u0027arco (with the back of the bow). \nThe trio of the minuet is scored for two solo violins each playing con sordino on single strings. The first violin plays the melody on the E string and the second violin tunes its G string down to F and plays a drone on the open string. \nThe Allegro di molto finale is interesting because it features its own internal Adagio e cantabile slow movement. The fast music is first interrupted by a solo string trio (two violins and cello) instructed to play piano e dolce. The rest of the orchestra elaborates on this slow section, including some passages for the string trios woodwind counterparts (two solo oboes and a bassoon), before the initial Allegro di molto section returns and Haydn brings the symphony to conclusion.",

He studied at the Stockholm Royal College of Music and the University of Uppsala, followed by studies of contemporary music at Darmstadt in 1949, Baroque music with Paul Sacher at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, and further conducting studies with Igor Markevitch, Jean Morel at the Juilliard School, and Leonard Bernstein at Tanglewood\u0027s Berkshire Music Center.\n\nHe won the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize in 1953 and the Salzburg Conducting Competition in 1955.[1]\n\nBlomstedt is most noted for his performances of German and Austrian composers, such as Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner and Richard Strauss, and also as a champion of Scandinavian composers, such as Edvard Grieg, Franz Berwald, Jean Sibelius and Carl Nielsen.\n\nA devout Seventh-day Adventist, Blomstedt does not rehearse on Friday nights or Saturdays, the Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism. He does, however, conduct concerts, since he considers actual performances to be an expression of his religious devotion rather than work.\n\nHe has been Music Director or Principal Conductor of the Norrk\u00F6ping Symphony Orchestra (1954-1962), Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra (1962-1968), Danish Radio Symphony (1967-1977) and Swedish Radio Symphony (1977-1982). From 1975-1985, he served as chief conductor of the Dresdner Staatskapelle, in the process making many well-regarded recordings, including works of Richard Strauss and the complete Beethoven and Schubert symphonies, and leading the orchestra on international tours.\n\nBlomstedt was music director of the San Francisco Symphony from 1985 to 1995. He led the orchestra on regular tours of Europe and Asia, and made numerous prize-winning recordings for London/Decca, winning two Grammy Awards, a Gramophone Award and a Grand Prix du Disque, as well as awards from Belgium, Germany and Japan. After leaving San Francisco full time, Blomstedt held principal conductorships with the North German Radio Symphony (1996-1998) and Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra (1998-2005).",
