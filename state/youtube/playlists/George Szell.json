Broadcast by CBS, simulcast to WCCO Minnesota where Reynolds Marchant recorded it on tape. \n\nI wish the quality of this recording was better - but given I cannot find this performance anywhere on the internet I figured it would be worth sharing anyway. I did some work trying to reduce the impact of the distorted parts with mixed results. \n\nThis is by far the earliest NY Philharmonic radio broadcast I\u2019ve come across in the archive - a clue is the paper-backed 3M tape - something that was only produced in 1947 (with the black oxide). You can tell it\u2019s paper because on the reels you see a white or light grey - that\u2019s the paper. In my other videos you would see acetate or other plastic backed which appears brown or black.\n\nThe super early formulation of tape might be part of the fidelity problem, but I think mostly Reynolds had not worked out the kinks on how to get a radio broadcast cleanly onto tape. It was clearly recorded too loud. By the time the rest of the recordings I\u2019ve already put online were captured in 1949, 1950 and beyond - he really had a great system and the quality of those is mostly stellar. But what do you think of this recording?\n\nThe program for the performance:\nhttps://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/9ae06c3f-2c18-4c04-9b65-617811d7ec20-0.1/fullview#page/1/mode/2up\n\nTechnical info:\nUnknown Scotch, probably 100A\n7\u201D Reel\n7 1/2 IPS\n\n00:00 - Allegro moderato\n10:57 - Andante con moto",

    "Description": "George Szell conducts the NY Philharmonic in performance of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\u2019s Symphony No 4 in F minor, Op. 36 on December 30th, 1951. \n\nHonestly this has got to be one of the best sounding and most exciting recordings from my archive. I was so thrilled to discover this. Every one of Szell\u2019s guest conducting appearances with the NY Philharmonic were special, but in this one is just so epic - the brass practically leap out of your speakers. It was recorded very \u201Chot\u201D (you can see the VU meter well into the red in the loud parts) but not hot enough for distortion. This was recorded from a direct line at WCCO (CBS broadcast partner station) so the fidelity is really great. \n\nIt\u2019s not perfect however! The reel had to be turned over about 6 minutes into the first movement - I tried to join them up as seamlessly as possible but there is still a tiny glitch. There is also sadly a bit over a minute missing from the start of the second movement. Other than those two small things we have a complete recording. \n\nI almost didn\u2019t post this - when I first heard the reel back in June of 2024 it was broken up over two sides of the reel and I heard the missing part of the second movement and actually stopped the tape thinking too much was lost. But reviewing my notes I pulled it back out and figured it was worth a re-listen and reconstruction and I\u2019m so glad I did. Do you agree this recording sounds incredible? Comment below!\n\nThe program from the performance:\nhttps://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/5eef3b04-9e8d-49b3-b452-c34c7b403a9d-0.1?search-type=singleFilter\u0026search-text=*\u0026search-dates-from=12%2F30%2F1951\u0026search-dates-to=12%2F30%2F1951\n\nThis video is from the same night:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6zbDr5y1HQ\n\nTechnical Info:\nUnknown Scotch tape type probably 111\n7\u201D reel\n7 1/2 IPS\nThere were a few radio or machine noise artifacts that were very noticeable in quieter sections.  I went in and did some surgical edits in Izotope\u2019s RX 11 Advanced to remove those noises. Thankfully most of it was sine waves at a fairly predictable frequency so it was easy to remove over the whole piece. \n\n00:07 - Andante sostenuto \u2013 Moderato con anima\n17:07 - Andantino in modo di canzona\n24:43 - Scherzo.
