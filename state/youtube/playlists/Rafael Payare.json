In the opening \u2019Reveries, Passions\u2019, Berlioz conjures up what he called \u2019volcanic love\u2019, followed by a waltzing ball scene and pastoral interlude. Then come the sinister \u2019March to the Scaffold\u2019 and nightmarish \u2019Dream of a Witches\u2019 Sabbath\u2019, reflecting what Berlioz described as the key elements of his style: \u2019passionate expression, inner warmth, rhythmic impetus and unexpectedness\u2019.\n\nTo browse the Royal College of Music\u2019s events season, visit https://www.rcm.ac.uk/events",

    "Description": "Find out more about the Royal College of Music at http://www.rcm.ac.uk\n\nGuest conductor Rafael Payare leads the RCM Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Skryabin\u2019s symphonic poem, written in the early 20th century. The composer wrote a poem over three hundred lines long to accompany the music, though not to be recited with it. The poem tracks the ascent of a spirit into consciousness, catalysed by the recurring appearance of \u2018trembling presentiments of dark rhythms\u2019 that later transform into \u2018bright presentiments of shining rhythms.\u2019 \n\nRecorded on 13 January 2019 in the Amaryllis Fleming Concert Hall at the Royal College of Music in London. \n\nSee what the #RCMCommunity is doing right now by following us on social media. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/royalcollegeofmusic  \nhttps://twitter.com/RCMLondon \nhttps://www.instagram.com/rcmlondon/",
