In the opening ’Reveries, Passions’, Berlioz conjures up what he called ’volcanic love’, followed by a waltzing ball scene and pastoral interlude. Then come the sinister ’March to the Scaffold’ and nightmarish ’Dream of a Witches’ Sabbath’, reflecting what Berlioz described as the key elements of his style: ’passionate expression, inner warmth, rhythmic impetus and unexpectedness’.\n\nTo browse the Royal College of Music’s events season, visit https://www.rcm.ac.uk/events",

    "Description": "Find out more about the Royal College of Music at http://www.rcm.ac.uk\n\nGuest conductor Rafael Payare leads the RCM Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Skryabin’s symphonic poem, written in the early 20th century. The composer wrote a poem over three hundred lines long to accompany the music, though not to be recited with it. The poem tracks the ascent of a spirit into consciousness, catalysed by the recurring appearance of ‘trembling presentiments of dark rhythms’ that later transform into ‘bright presentiments of shining rhythms.’ \n\nRecorded on 13 January 2019 in the Amaryllis Fleming Concert Hall at the Royal College of Music in London. \n\nSee what the #RCMCommunity is doing right now by following us on social media. \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/royalcollegeofmusic  \nhttps://twitter.com/RCMLondon \nhttps://www.instagram.com/rcmlondon/",
