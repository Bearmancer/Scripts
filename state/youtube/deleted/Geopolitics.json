    "Title": "Inside the Politics of America’s Gun Debate | Gunned Down (full documentary) | FRONTLINE",
    "Description": "In 2015’s “Gunned Down: The Power of the NRA,” FRONTLINE examined the National Rifle Association’s political evolution and influence, and how it had consistently succeeded in defeating gun control legislation. (Aired 2015)\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nDrawing on interviews with leading voices on both sides of the gun regulation debate, “Gunned Down” went inside one of the country’s greatest divides to illuminate how the NRA reinvented itself from a group of gun enthusiasts and sportsmen with minimal political focus, to a powerful lobbying force opposing any perceived infringement of the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\nThe documentary traced the emergence of Wayne LaPierre, then one of the NRA’s top leaders, and explores how he activated the group’s influential base in the wake of mass shootings. The film featured interviews with Congressional leaders, former White House officials, then-Vice President Joe Biden, and gun-rights and gun-reform advocates. It also featured firsthand accounts from family members of mass shooting victims, including the deadly 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nFor more on the evolution of the NRA and America’s gun debate, watch FRONTLINE’s 2020 documentary “NRA Under Fire,” which investigated the organization’s history and evolution, how it aligned with President Donald Trump and his base, and why it was under attack ahead of the 2020 election. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/nra-under-fire/\n \n“Gunned Down” is a FRONTLINE production with the Kirk Documentary Group.

    "Title": "NATO - The largest military alliance in the world | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "Since 1949, NATO has shaped Europe‘s security policy like no other organization. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty outlines the principle of \"collective defense”. But is the world's largest military alliance ready to defend itself?\n\nMarking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this documentary looks at the past, present and future of NATO. Among other things, it sheds light on vulnerabilities. For example, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is anything but binding. Unanimity among the member states is a prerequisite -- but by no means a certainty. And there are only partial guarantees in place when it comes to the speed with which troops and supplies must be delivered in extreme situations.\n\nThe film embarks on a journey across the Alliance's territory. The filmmakers visit Tallinn, in Estonia, where NATO's Cyber Defence Centre is located. From here they travel on to Ulm, in Germany, where the deployment of troops and supplies is organized. The next stop is NATO headquarters in Brussels, where political decisions are made. The film hears from high-ranking current and former NATO generals and security experts along the way.\n\nWith the help of international historians, the documentary also looks back on the 75-year history of NATO. Founded after the devastating experiences of the Second World War, the alliance’s architects wanted to deter enemies. But even more importantly, they wanted to secure peace among the alliance partners - not least out of fears of Germany regaining strength. \n\nThe documentary draws on previously unseen archival film material: NATO portraits of member countries filmed in the 1950s to give soldiers a better understanding of one another’s countries and thus enhance cohesion.\n\nImportant eyewitnesses, including Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton and diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, are featured. They provide context for recent NATO developments: How close was the US to leaving NATO in 2018? And what would the consequences have been? Was a promise really made not to expand NATO eastwards after the collapse of the Soviet Union? The film seeks an answer to this question, which continues to shape Russia's relationship with NATO to this day. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "The Stasi and the Berlin Wall | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "For one group, at least, the erection of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961 was a stroke of luck. Over the following decades, the Wall would be the lifeblood of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi. By the time the Wall fell, in 1989, thousands of Stasi agents were employed with a single goal: to make the Wall insurmountable.\n\nThe film tells the story of this existentially symbiotic relationship from the perspective of the Stasi under its notorious leader Erich Mielke. It’s the first time this most sensitive chapter of East Germany's history has been told in such an exemplary and coherent way: including the deaths that took place at the Wall, and the cover-up and concealment of many of those murders.\n\nWe learn about the arrests and imprisonment of tens of thousands of refugees, as well as the Stasi’s elaborate construction of tunnels and underground listening stations to track down tunnel diggers. From the billion-dollar business of selling GDR prisoners to West Germany, to the \"filtering\" of Western traffic at border crossings to recruit unofficial collaborators, Mielke's specialists were everywhere. \n\nWe see how Mielke's power grew, as the Wall and the border system were perfected, and how the walling-in of the population created more and more work for the Stasi. The Wall became the Stasi’s main field of activity, and its daily bread.\n\nThe fall of the Wall brought an abrupt end to both East Germany and its security apparatus. An irony of history is that, on November 9, 1989, it was a Stasi man who opened the first barrier on Bornholmer Strasse and thus initiated the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n#dwdocumentary #berlinwall #documentary\n\n__\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "Yemen and the Houthis: Pirates, terrorists, freedom fighters? | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "The Houthi militia has been fighting for supremacy in Yemen for years. The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.\n\nYemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. \n\nA proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.\n\nFollowing Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.\nBetween blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #yemen #houthi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "Exploiting Africa - How China and Europe hunt for the raw materials of the future | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "The global race for the African continent‘s coveted raw materials is unscrupulous. The raw material interests of rich nations often trump the rights and needs of the local populations.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, people are being exploited in mines. Chinese traders are illegally buying cobalt, a material Europe needs for its green energy transition. Therefore, Europe buys the cobalt from these illegal traders. The EU now wants to free itself from its dependence on China for raw materials and expand its own local activities. They promise to act more fairly than China - though some say this is not a reasonable promise.\nA huge hydrogen project involving Germany is being planned on the south-east coast of Namibia. The local population is also supposed to benefit from it. However, parts of a national park will be destroyed by the billions being spent in the name of green investment. \"Why doesn't Germany sacrifice its own protected parks for green hydrogen?” asks Namibia's well-known environmental activist Chris Brown. \nIn the oil-contaminated mangrove forests of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, it becomes clear that Europe is not as climate-friendly as it likes to claim. After all, since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, numerous European investors have been attempting to discreetly arrange lucrative natural gas deals in the country. Congolese activist Patricia Kashala also complains that Europe gives the impression of acting in an exemplary manner, but in practice often puts its own interests in raw materials above the rights of the local population.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #africa #europe #china \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Description": "The Ukrainian intelligence service has intercepted thousands of Russian soldiers' telephone conversations. They are harrowing testimonies to the cruelty of war. In this film, the calls are juxtaposed against images of the destruction of Ukraine.\n\nOksana Karpovych's documentary sets images of the war in Ukraine against audio of Russian soldiers phoning their families from the front line. It links the destruction of the nation with those responsible for it, thus highlighting the tragedy of war. But the documentary also shows Ukrainians trying to live relatively normal lives despite the attack on their country.\n\nTension can be heard in the voices of the Russian soldiers. Their accounts reflect the phases they have gone through during their deployment, from a sense of supposed heroism in response to propaganda, to doubt and subsequent disillusionment. Sometimes the fighters lose their heads, committing looting and other crimes. These diverse recordings reveal the full extent of Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nThe award-winning and acclaimed film is a powerful document about the dehumanizing power of war. The juxtaposition of images of the war with the intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers and their relatives amounts to a profound reflection on the banality of evil.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine #russiaukrainewar \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Description": "Deutsche Bank managers driven by greed set it on the wrong track in the 2000s. For many years, the financial institution maintained close ties with Vladimir Putin. And involved itself in shady deals with the Russian autocrat.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Deutsche Bank wanted to make it big in Moscow. For some employees, this was something to be achieved by any means necessary: bribing Putin’s officials, brothel visits for good customers, money laundering for the mafia.\n\nWhen it all came to light, this sent a shock wave through the bank: to this day, Deutsche Bank is still laboring under the burden of fines totaling billions. But the CEOs claimed total innocence. Just one of many scandals.\n\nOther questionable deals include loans to Donald Trump. The bank’s very special relationship with the US-American real estate tycoon began in the year 1998. Trump was one of Deutsche Bank’s best customers until shortly before his 2017 presidency. The credit institute loaned him huge sums - despite his track record for business bankruptcy and a dubious reputation as a defaulting debtor.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #deutschebank \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

From its beginnings right through to the present day, the country's armed forces have shaped both American identity and the political decisions of its leaders.\n\nThe United States of America has been at war throughout most of its 250-year existence. From the War of Independence right through to contemporary armed conflicts, the nation's armed forces have not only shaped American identity but also influenced the political decisions of its leaders.\nThe documentary takes a deep dive into this complex history and analyzes the \"hot\" and \"cold\" wars that have shaped US history in order to draw important lessons for the future.\n\nThe film explores how successive generations of US Americans viewed and experienced each conflict. It also examines the enduring impact of these wars on American society and reveals how military engagement was utilized to hone the image and the role of the US on the global stage.\nAround 30 high-profile experts, military personnel and politicians examine the military history of the United States, explaining its successes and failures, as well as its impact on the world and the everyday lives of Americans.\n\nThe film looks to the past to gain a keener understanding of how today's military decisions will affect tomorrow's world — as well as their far-reaching impact on democracy and society. And with US President Donald Trump now in office for a second term, it asks what role the army plays in Trump's world view.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #usa #war \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Description": "The Nuremberg trials started 80 years ago and marked a milestone in the establishment of international law. The images of high-ranking Nazis in the dock are seared into our collective memory.\n\nThe Nuremberg trials were a series of military tribunals staged by the Allies after World War Two. The first and best-known trial ended in October 1946 with the sentencing to death of 12 high-ranking Nazis.  Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, Hermann Göring, Germany’s foreign minister during the Nazi regime, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Armaments Minister and chief architect Albert Speer, anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher and high-ranking SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner were among those in the dock. The court met for the first time in Nuremberg in November 1945 and was in session for 218 days.\nBy making the Nazi elite answer for their crimes in this hugely complex trial, the Allies ushered in the era of modern international law. Using photos and archive film material, the documentary reconstructs what went on in the court room, as well as revealing what went on behind the scenes. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #nurembergtrials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    "Title": "Gambled away in the financial crisis - The Deutsche Bank story | DW Documentary",
    "Description": "Deutsche Bank managers driven by greed set it on the wrong track in the 2000s. The collapse played a key role in the financial crisis of 2007/2008. The consequences: billions of Euros in penalties and the decline of a German institution.\n\nThe Deutsche Bank, once the flagship of the German economy, had fallen from grace. In the 2000s, the bank was pumped full of risk in the quest for ever greater profits. In their bid to make the institution a global player, Deutsche Bank managers gave their investment bankers a free hand - a move that would end up being a major contributing factor in the financial crisis of 2007/2008. Supervisory authorities are still imposing fines to this day, penalties that now run into the tens of billions.\n\nThe victims in all of this are Deutsche Bank customers and shareholders. The share price is hovering around 10 Euros. Twenty years ago, it was around 60 Euros. The documentary shows: The only ones to walk away from this with a good deal were the investment bankers.

    "Title": "Why China's manufacturing economy is dominating — Arthur Kroeber",
    "Description": "Arthur Kroeber is a leading researcher on Chinese tech and macro, a founding partner at Gavekal Dragonomics, and author of \"China's Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know\". It's the most useful, detailed resource I've found of how China actually works. On this episode, we discuss how China achieved high-tech manufacturing dominance, and where they'll go from here. By Arthur’s account, the Chinese government is like a giant VC fund: they decide on key priorities and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing ruthless competition at the local level. They are willing to lose huge amounts of money for a few of their bets to pay off: at China’s scale, effectiveness matters more than efficiency. There's also a growing bipartisan consensus that we need to combat China's rise. This doesn’t make much sense to me. China is a big, powerful country at the frontier in many fields, and its economy is intricately tied in with our own. Being instinctively adversarial is both unsustainable and risky. Arthur and I discuss how we can create a productive, mutually beneficial version of this relationship.\n\n𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒\n* Transcript: https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/arthur-kroeber\n* Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dwarkesh-podcast/id1516093381?i=1000713627073\n* Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2EXad7ZEt0oXezigqd7WLe?si=45d9402e6fce4095\n* Get Arthur's book: https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Economy-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0190239034\n\n𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒\n* Scale is building the infrastructure for smarter, safer AI.

It examines the trajectory of his life, from being sent to the countryside to perform hard labor during the Maoist revolution, to his embrace of the Chinese Communist Party and his rise through its leadership, to how he has tightened his grip throughout his presidency.\n\n“China, the U.S. & the Rise of Xi Jinping” is a FRONTLINE production with RAIN Media, Inc.

    "Description": "FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith travels to Syria’s Idlib province and becomes the first Western journalist to interview one of the most wanted men in the world: Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, designated a terrorist by the U.S., whose Islamist group is the dominant force in Syria’s last opposition stronghold.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate.\n\nJolani’s group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and its earlier incarnations stand accused of human rights violations — including indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, torture and arbitrary arrests of civilians — and much of his life has been a roadmap of Islamist militancy in Iraq and Syria. But Jolani now says that he is seeking a new relationship with the West. In “The Jihadist,” Smith investigates Jolani’s rebranding efforts, and tracks down and interviews his critics and victims.\n\nThe documentary examines the fight over the future of Idlib, Jolani’s emergence as a leading Islamist militant, and his efforts — despite his history with Al Qaeda and allegations of human rights abuses — to change his image into that of a viable leader who is not a danger to the United States and Europe.\n\n“The Jihadist” is produced, written and directed by Martin Smith and Marcela Gaviria, with Smith as correspondent, and co-produced by Brian Funck and Scott Anger.\n\nFor more reporting in connection with this investigation, visit FRONTLINE’s website:\nhttps://to.pbs.org/3vMoAYU\n\n#Documentary #Syria #Idlib\n\nLove FRONTLINE?
